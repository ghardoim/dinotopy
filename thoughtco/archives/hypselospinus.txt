hypselospinus is just one of many dinosaurs that started its taxonomic life as a species of iguanodon (since iguanodon was discovered so early in the history of modern paleontology, it became a "wastebasket genus" to which many poorly understood dinosaurs were assigned). classified as iguanodon fittoni in 1889, by richard lydekker, this ornithopod lumbered in obscurity for well over 100 years, until a re-examination of its remains in 2010 prompted the creation of a new genus. otherwise very similar to iguanodon, the early cretaceous hypselospinus was distinguished by the short vertebral spines along its upper back, which likely supported a flexible flap of skin.
