at the height of the bone wars, in the late 19th century, new dinosaurs were being named faster than convincing fossil evidence could be gathered to support them. a good example is laosaurus, which was erected by the famous paleontologist othniel c. marsh on the basis of a handful of vertebrae discovered in wyoming. (soon after, marsh created two new laosaurus species, but then reconsidered and assigned one specimen to the genus dryosaurus.) after decades of further confusion—in which species of laosaurus were transferred to, or were considered for inclusion under, orodromeus and othnielia—this late jurassic ornithopod lapsed into obscurity and is today considered a nomen dubium.
