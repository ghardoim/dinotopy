did zuolong taste good when it was chopped up into little bits, deep fried, and slathered in sweet sauce? we'll never know for sure, which is why it's ironic that this late jurassic "dino-bird" was named after the 19th-century general tso, whose name has been appropriated by thousands of chinese restaurants in the u.s. "tso's dragon," as zuolong translates, is important for being one of the most primitive "coelurosaurs" (i.e., feathered dinosaurs related to coelurus) yet identified, and is known by a single, well-preserved skeleton discovered in china. zuolong coexisted with two other, larger theropods, sinraptor and monolophosaurus, that may well have hunted it down for dinner (or at least ordered it out on the phone).
