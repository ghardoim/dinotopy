ankylosaurs—armored dinosaurs—are most often associated with north america and asia, but some important species lived midway between, in europe. to date, hungarosaurus is the best-attested ankylosaur of europe, represented by the remains of four huddled-together individuals (it's uncertain whether hungarosaurus was a social dinosaur, or if these individuals happened to wash up in the same place after drowning in a flash flood). technically a nodosaur, and thus lacking a clubbed tail, hungarosaurus was a medium-sized plant eater characterized by its thick, almost impenetrable, body armor—and would thus not have been the first dinner choice of the hungry raptors and tyrannosaurs of its hungarian ecosystem.
