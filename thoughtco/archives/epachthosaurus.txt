not all the dinosaurs that flourished at the end of the cretaceous period (right before the k/t extinction) represented the pinnacle of evolution. a good example is epachthosaurus, which paleontologists classify as a titanosaur, even though it appears to have lacked the armor plating that usually characterized these late, geographically widespread sauropods. the basal epachthosaurus seems to have been a "throwback" to earlier sauropod anatomy, especially as concerned the primitive structure of its vertebrae, yet it still somehow managed to coexist alongside more advanced members of the breed.
