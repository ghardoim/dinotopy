if you think the last thing the world needs is another dinosaur with an unpronounceable name, rest assured that very few paleontologists accept the validity of sigilmassasaurus, though this carnivore has still managed to retain its place in the official record books. discovered in morocco near the ancient city of sijilmassa, sigilmassasaurus (about 30 feet long and 1-2 tons) had a lot in common with the better known and equally multisyllabic carcharodontosaurus ("great white shark lizard"), of which it was probably a species. however, the possibility does remain that sigilmassasaurus deserves its genus designationâ€”and that it may not be a carcharodontosaur at all but another undetermined type of large theropod.
