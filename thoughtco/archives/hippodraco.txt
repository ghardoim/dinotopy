one of a pair of ornithopod dinosaurs recently unearthed in utah—the other being the impressively named iguanacolossus—hippodraco, the "horse dragon," was on the small side for an iguanodon relative, only about 15 feet long and half a ton (which may be a clue that the sole, incomplete specimen is of a juvenile rather than a full-grown adult). dating to the early cretaceous period, about 125 million years ago, hippodraco appears to have been a comparatively "basal" iguanodont whose closest relative was the slightly later (and still extremely obscure) theiophytalia.
