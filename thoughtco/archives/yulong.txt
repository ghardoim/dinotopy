the late cretaceous fossil beds of china are thick with feathered dinosaurs of all sizes and types. one of the most recent species to join the theropod pack is yulong, a close relative of oviraptor that was significantly smaller than most dinosaurs of this type (only about a foot to a foot and a half long, compared to truly enormous members of the breed like gigantoraptor). somewhat unusually, yulong's "type fossil" was pieced together from five separate fragmented juvenile specimens; the same team of paleontologists also discovered a fossilized yulong embryo still inside its egg.
