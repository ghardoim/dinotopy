as far as paleontologists can tell, riojasaurus represents an intermediate stage between the small prosauropods of the triassic period (such as efraasia and camelotia) and the huge sauropods of the jurassic and cretaceous periods (typified by such giants as diplodocus and brachiosaurus). this prosauropod was very large for its time--one of the biggest animals to roam south america during the late triassic period--with the long neck and tail characteristic of later sauropods. its closest relative was probably the south african melanorosaurus (south america and africa being joined together in the supercontinent gondwana 200 million years ago).
