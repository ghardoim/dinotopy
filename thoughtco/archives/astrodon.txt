for an official state dinosaur (it was thus honored by maryland in 1998), astrodon has a fairly checkered provenance. this medium-sized sauropod was a close relative of the more famous brachiosaurus, and it may or may not have been the same animal as pleurocoelus, the current state dinosaur of texas (which may itself soon lose its title to a more worthy candidate, the situation in the lone star state being in a state of flux). the importance of astrodon is more historical than paleontological; two of its teeth were unearthed in maryland way back in 1859, the first well-attested dinosaur discovery in that small state.
