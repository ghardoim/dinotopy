quick: what other meat-eating dinosaur of the middle cretaceous period had a sailed back, a long, narrow, crocodilian snout, and a weight class in the tyrannosaurus rex range? if you answered spinosaurus, that's pretty much all you need to know about angaturama (30 feet long, 2 tons), a close (albeit much smaller) relative of spinosaurus that was unearthed in brazil in 1991. brazilian national pride has resulted in the "type fossil" of angaturama being assigned to its own genus, though some paleontologists speculate that it may actually have been a species of irritator, yet another spinosaur from south america.
