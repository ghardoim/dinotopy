known from a single specimen--which was discovered in a curled-up posture, either because it was sleeping or because it was huddling to protect itself from the elements--sinornithoides was a small, agile, feathered theropod that resembled a (much) smaller version of the more famous troodon. like other troodonts, as they're called, the early cretaceous sinornithoides probably feasted on a large selection of prey, ranging from insects to lizards to its fellow dinosaurs--and, in turn, it was probably preyed on by the larger feathered dinosaurs of its asian habitat.
