discovered in 1986 in montana's two medicine formation, but only formally named in 2013, oohkotokia ("large stone" in the indigenous blackfoot language) was an armored dinosaur closely related to euoplocephalus and dyoplosaurus. not everyone agrees that oohkotokia merits its own genus; one recent examination of its fragmented remains has concluded that it was a specimen, or species, of an even more obscure genus of ankylosaur, scolosaurus. (perhaps some of the controversy can be traced to the fact that oohkotokia's species name, horneri, honors the rabble-rousing paleontologist jack horner.)
