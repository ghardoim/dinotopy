unlike its similarly named cousin, dilophosaurus, monolophosaurus (about 17 feet long, 1,500 pounds) hasn't quite seized the public's imagination—even though this allosaur (as it has tentatively been classified) was slightly bigger than dilophosaurus and probably more dangerous. like all theropods, monolophosaurus was a meat-eating biped, and judging by geological clues from where it was discovered, it likely prowled the lake beds and riversides of middle jurassic asia. why did monolophosaurus have that single, prominent crest on top of its head? as with all such anatomical features, this was likely a sexually selected characteristic—that is, males with bigger crests were dominant in the pack and could more easily mate with females.
