paleontologists are still trying to sort out the bewildering number of small, feathered theropods that prowled the deserts and plains of late cretaceous central asia (e.g., present-day mongolia). discovered in 1970, elmisaurus was clearly a close relative of oviraptor, though how much so is unclear since the "type fossil" consists of a hand and a foot. that didn't stop paleontologist william j. currie from identifying a second elmisaurus species, e. elegans, from a set of bones previously attributed to ornithomimus; however, the weight of opinion is that this was really a species (or specimen) of chirostenotes.
