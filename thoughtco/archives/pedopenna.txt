for the past 25 years or so, paleontologists have driven themselves crazy trying to figure out where the dinosaur evolutionary tree ends and the bird evolutionary tree begins. a case study in this ongoing state of confusion is pedopenna, a tiny, birdlike theropod that was contemporary with two other famous jurassic dino-birds, archaeopteryx and epidendrosaurus. pedopenna clearly had many birdlike features, and may have been capable of climbing (or fluttering) into trees and hopping from branch to branch. like another early dino-bird, microraptor, pedopenna may also have sported primitive wings on both its arms and its legs.
