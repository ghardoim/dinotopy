as a rule, hadrosaurs were mostly confined to late cretaceous north america and eurasia, but there were some strays, as witness the discovery of secernosaurus in argentina. this small- to medium-sized herbivore (only about 10 feet long and weighing 500 to 1,000 pounds) was very similar to the bigger kritosaurus from further north, and one recent paper makes the case that at least one presumed species of kritosaurus properly belongs under the secernosaurus umbrella. reconstructed from scattered fossils, secernosaurus remains a very mysterious dinosaur; our understanding of it should be helped by future south american hadrosaur discoveries.
