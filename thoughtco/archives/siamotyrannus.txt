you might assume from its name that siamotyrannus (20 feet long, 1,000-2,000 pounds) was an asian contemporary and close relative of tyrannosaurus rex, but the fact is that this large theropod lived tens of millions of years before its more famous namesakeâ€”and is considered by most paleontologists to be a carnosaur rather than a true tyrannosaur. one of the few dinosaurs of any kind to be unearthed in modern-day thailand, siamotyrannus will have to be supported by more fossil discoveries before it takes up more than a footnote in the official theropod record books.
