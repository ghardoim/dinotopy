the slim, fast, two-legged othnielia was named after the famous paleontologist othniel c. marsh—not by marsh himself (who lived in the 19th century), but by a tribute-paying paleontologist in 1977. (oddly, othnielia is very similar to drinker, another small, jurassic plant-eater named after marsh's arch-nemesis edward drinker cope.) in many ways, othnielia was a typical ornithopod of the late jurassic period. this dinosaur may have lived in herds, and it certainly figured on the dinner menu of the larger, carnivorous theropods of its day—which goes a long way toward explaining its presumed speed and agility.
