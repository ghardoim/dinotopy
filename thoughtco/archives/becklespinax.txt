one of the most oddly named of all dinosaurs—try saying becklespinax 10 times fast and keeping a straight face—this large theropod was also one of the most mysterious. it was diagnosed on the basis of three fossilized vertebrae. what is known: it was a respectably sized carnivorous dinosaur (about 20 feet long and weighed 1 ton) of early cretaceous england, and it may (or may not) have sported a short sail, akin to those of later meat-eaters like spinosaurus. judging by the ecosystem in which it lived, becklespinax probably hunted small- to medium-sized sauropods.
