as is the case with many dinosaurs, the only fossil specimen of aegyptosaurus was destroyed in an allied air raid on munich toward the end of world war ii (meaning that paleontologists only had a dozen years to study this dinosaur's "type fossil", which was unearthed in egypt in 1932). although the original specimen is no longer available, we know that aegyptosaurus was one of the bigger cretaceous titanosaurs (an offshoot of the sauropods of the earlier jurassic period) and that it, or at least its juveniles, may have figured on the lunch menu of the equally gigantic carnivore spinosaurus.
