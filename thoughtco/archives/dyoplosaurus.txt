dyoplosaurus is one of those dinosaurs that has faded in and out of history. when this ankylosaur was discovered, in 1924, it was given its name (greek for "well-armored lizard") by paleontologist william parks. almost half a century later, in 1971, another scientist determined that the remains of dyoplosaurus were indistinguishable from those of the better-known euoplocephalus, causing the former name to pretty much disappear. but fast-forward another 40 years, to 2011, and dyoplosaurus was resurrected: yet another analysis concluded that certain features of this ankylosaur (such as its distinctive club tail) merited its own genus assignation after all.
