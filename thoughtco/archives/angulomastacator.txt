you can glean everything you need to know about angulomastacator from its clunky name, greek for "bent chewer." this late cretaceous hadrosaur (duck-billed dinosaur) resembled others of its kind in most ways, with the exception of its oddly angled upper jaw, the purpose of which remains a mystery (even the paleontologists who discovered this dinosaur describe it as "enigmatic") but probably had something to do with its accustomed diet. its strange skull aside, angulomastacator is classified as a "lambeosaurine" hadrosaur, meaning it was closely related to the much better known lambeosaurus.
