for all intents and purposes, saurornithoides was the central asian version of the easier-to-pronounce north american troodon, a human-sized, bipedal predator that chased small birds and lizards across the dusty plains (and that may also have been smarter than the average dinosaur, judging by its larger-than-average brain). the relatively large size of saurornithoides' eyes are a clue that it probably hunted for food at night, the better to stay out of the way of the larger theropods of late cretaceous asia that might otherwise have it for lunch.
