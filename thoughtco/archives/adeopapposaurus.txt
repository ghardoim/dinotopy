when its type fossil was discovered a couple of years ago in south america, adeopapposaurus was believed to be a species of a more famous prosauropod of the early jurassic period, the african massospondylus. later analysis showed that this medium-sized herbivore deserved its own genus, though its close relationship to massospondylus remains beyond dispute. like other prosauropods, adeopapposaurus possessed a long neck and tail (though nowhere near as long as the necks and tail of later sauropods), and it was probably capable of walking on two feet when circumstances demanded.
