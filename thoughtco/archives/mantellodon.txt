gideon mantell was often ignored in his time (notably by the famous paleontologist richard owen), but today he has no less than three dinosaurs named after him: gideonmantellia, mantellisaurus, and (the most dubious of the bunch) mantellodon. in 2012, gregory paul "rescued" mantellodon from iguanodon, where it had previously been assigned as a separate species, and raised it to genus status. the trouble is, there's significant disagreement about whether mantellodon merits this distinction; at least one scientist insists it should properly be assigned as a species of the iguanodon-like ornithopod mantellisaurus.
