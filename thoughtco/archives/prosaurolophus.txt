as you might have guessed from its name, prosaurolophus ("before saurolophus") is a good candidate for the common ancestor of both saurolophus and the more famous parasaurolophus (which lived a few million years later). all three of these beasts were hadrosaurs, or duck-billed dinosaurs, large, occasionally bipedal quadrupeds that grazed vegetation off the forest floor. given its evolutionary precedence, prosaurolophus had a minimal head crest compared to its descendants â€” a mere bump, really, which later expanded in saurolophus and parasaurolophus into the huge, ornate, hollow structures used to signal herd members from miles away.
