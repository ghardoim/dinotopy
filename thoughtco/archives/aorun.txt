there were a bewildering number of small, probably feathered theropods roaming late jurassic asia, many of them closely related to the north american coelurus (and thus referred to as "coelurosaurian" dinosaurs). discovered in 2006, but only formally announced in 2013, aorun was a fairly typical early theropod, albeit with slight anatomical differences that distinguished it from fellow meat-eaters like guanlong and sinraptor. it's as yet unknown whether or not aorun was covered with feathers, or how large the full-grown adults were (the "type specimen" is of a year-old juvenile).
