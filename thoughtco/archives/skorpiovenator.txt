first things first: the name skorpiovenator (greek for "scorpion hunter") has nothing to do with this dinosaur's presumed diet; rather, it's because the sole fossil specimen was surrounded by a bustling colony of living scorpions. other than its striking name, skorpiovenator (about 30 feet long and weighing 1 ton) was an average large theropod of the middle cretaceous period, with a short, blunt skull covered by a weird array of ridges and bumps. this has prompted experts to assign it to the abelisaurs, a sub-family of large theropods (poster genus: abelisaurus) that were especially common in south america.
