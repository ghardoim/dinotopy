more often than you might think, dinosaurs are "rediscovered" decades after their fossils were first unearthed. such is the case with xenoposeidon, which was recently assigned to its own genus based on a single, partial bone dug up in england in the late 19th century. the problem is, although xenoposeidon was clearly a type of sauropod, the shape of this vertebra (specifically, the forward slope of its neural arch) doesn't fit comfortably into any known family, prompting a pair of paleontologists to propose its inclusion in an entirely new sauropod group. as to what xenoposeidon looked like, that remains a mystery; depending on further research, it may have been built along the lines of either diplodocus or brachiosaurus.
