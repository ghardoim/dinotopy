yet another notch in the belt of the famous chinese paleontologist dong zhiming, who discovered its scattered fossils in 1983, xiaosaurus was a small, inoffensive, plant-eating ornithopod of the late jurassic period that may have been ancestral to hypsilophodon (and may itself have been descended from fabrosaurus). other than those bare facts, though, not much is known about this dinosaur, and xiaosaurus may yet turn out to be a species of an already-named genus of ornithopod (a situation that can only be resolved pending further fossil discoveries).
