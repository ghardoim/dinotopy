as is the case with many titanosaurs--the huge, sometimes lightly armored sauropods that dominated the cretaceous period--all we know of andesaurus comes from a few fossilized bones, including parts of the backbone and scattered ribs. from these limited remains, though, paleontologists have been able to reproduce (with a high degree of accuracy) what this herbivore must have looked like--and it may well have been huge enough (over 100 feet from head to tail) to rival another south american sauropod, argentinosaurus (which some paleontologists classify as a "basal," or primitive, titanosaur itself).
