one of the few dinosaurs to be named after a corporation (atlas copco, a swedish manufacturer of mining equipment, which paleontologists find very useful in their field work), atlascopcosaurus was a small ornithopod of the cretaceous period that bore a marked resemblance to hypsilophodon. this australian dinosaur was discovered and described by the husband-and-wife team of tim and patricia vickers-rich, who diagnosed atlascopcosaurus on the basis of widely scattered fossil remains, almost 100 separate bone fragments consisting mostly of jaws and teeth.
