a bewildering array of large theropods roamed the woodlands of eurasia during the early to mid-cretaceous period. among the biggest of the bunch was chilantaisaurus (about 25 feet long, 4 tons), only about half the size of a full-grown tyrannosaurus rexâ€”which lived tens of millions of years later but was still impressive. chilantaisaurus was once thought to be closely related to the slightly earlier allosaurus of north america, but it now seems that it may have been an early member of the line of carnivorous dinosaurs that went on to produce the truly gigantic spinosaurus.
