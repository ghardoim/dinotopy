for years, rapetosaurus (the "mischievous lizard") was the only titanosaur known to have lived on the indian ocean island of madagascar--and it was a pretty well-attested dinosaur at that, represented by thousands of scattered fossils dating to the late cretaceous period. in 2014, though, researchers announced the existence of a second, rarer genus of titanosaur, which was closely related not to rapetosaurus but to the indian titanosaurs jainosaurus and isisaurus. there's still a lot we don't know about vahiny (malagasy for "traveler"), a situation that should hopefully change as more of its fossils are identified.
