there seems to be a rule in paleontology that the number of genera remains constant: while some dinosaurs are demoted from their genus status (that is, reclassified as individuals of already-named genera), others are promoted in the opposite direction. such is the case with uteodon, which for over a century was considered a specimen, and then a separate species, of the well-known north american ornithopod camptosaurus. even though it was technically distinct from camptosaurus (specifically as concerns the morphology of its braincase and shoulders), uteodon probably led the same kind of lifestyle, browsing vegetation and running away at top speed from hungry predators.
