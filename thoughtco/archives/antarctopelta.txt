the "type fossil" of the ankylosaur (armored dinosaur) antarctopelta was dug up on antarctica's james ross island in 1986, but it wasn’t until 20 years later that this genus was named and identified. antarctopelta is one of a handful of dinosaurs (and the first ankylosaur) known to have lived in antarctica during the cretaceous period (another being the two-legged theropod cryolophosaurus), but this wasn’t because of the harsh climate: 100 million years ago, antarctica was a lush, humid, densely forested land mass, not the icebox it is today. rather, as you can imagine, the frigid conditions on this vast continent don't exactly lend themselves to fossil hunting.
