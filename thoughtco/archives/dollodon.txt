the euphonious-sounding dollodon—named after the belgian paleontologist louis dollo, and not because it looked like a child's doll—is another of those dinosaurs that had the misfortune to be lumped in as a species of iguanodon in the late 19th century. further examination of this ornithopod's remains resulted in its being assigned to its own genus; with its long, thick body and small, narrow head, there's no mistaking dollodon's kinship to iguanodon, but its relatively long arms and distinctively rounded beak peg it as its own dinosaur.
