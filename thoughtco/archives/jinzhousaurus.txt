the early cretaceous jinzhousaurus existed at a time when the iguanodon-like ornithopods of asia were just beginning to evolve into the first hadrosaurs. as a result, paleontologists aren't quite sure what to make of this dinosaur; some say that jinzhousaurus was a classic "iguanodont," while others peg it as a basal hadrosaur, or "hadrosauroid." what makes this state of affairs especially frustrating is that jinzhousaurus is represented by a complete, if somewhat squashed, fossil specimen, a relative rarity for dinosaurs from this period.
