yunnanosaurus is important for two reasons: first, this is one of the latest prosauropods (the distant cousins of the gigantic sauropods) to be identified in the fossil record, prowling the woodlands of asia well into the early jurassic period. and second, the preserved skulls of yunnanosaurus contain over 60 relatively advanced, sauropod-like teeth, an unexpected development in such an early dinosaur (and one that may well have been the result of convergent evolution). the closest relative of yunnanosaurus appears to have been another asian prosauropod, lufengosaurus.
