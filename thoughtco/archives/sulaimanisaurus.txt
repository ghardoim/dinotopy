historically, pakistan hasn't yielded much in the way of dinosaurs (but, thanks to the vagaries of geology, this country is rich in prehistoric whales). the late cretaceous titanosaur sulaimanisaurus was "diagnosed" by pakistani paleontologist sadiq malkani from limited remains; malkani has also named the titanosaur genera khetranisaurus, pakisaurus, balochisaurus, and marisaurus, on the basis of equally fragmentary evidence. whether these titanosaurs--or malkani's proposed family for them, the "pakisauridae"--gain any traction will depend on future fossil discoveries; for now, most are considered dubious.
