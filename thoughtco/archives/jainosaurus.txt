it's rather unusual for a paleontologist who has had a dinosaur named after him to insist that the genus is a nomen dubium--but that's the case with jainosaurus, whose honoree, indian paleontologist sohan lal jain, believes this dinosaur should actually be classified as a species (or specimen) of titanosaurus. initially assigned to antarctosaurus, a dozen years after its type fossil was discovered in india in 1920, jainosaurus was a typical titanosaur, a medium-sized ("only" about 20 ton) plant eater covered with light body armor. it was probably closely related to another indian titanosaur of the late cretaceous period, isisaurus.
