compared to other parts of the world, very few "basal" ornithopods—small, bipedal, plant-eating dinosaurs—have been identified in asia (one notable exception is the early cretaceous jeholosaurus, which weighed about 100 pounds soaking wet). that's why the discovery of haya made such big news: this lightweight ornithopod lived during the late cretaceous period, about 85 million years ago, in an area of central asia corresponding to modern-day mongolia. (still, we can't tell whether the paucity of basal ornithopods is because they were indeed rare animals, or just didn't fossilize all that well). haya is also one of the few ornithopods known to have swallowed gastroliths, stones that helped grind down vegetable matter in this dinosaur's stomach.
