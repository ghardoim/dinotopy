the reputation of bothriospondylus has taken a major hit over the last century or so. "diagnosed" in 1875 by the famous paleontologist richard owen, on the basis of four enormous vertebrae unearthed in an english geologic formation, bothriospondylus was ostensibly a giant, late jurassic sauropod along the lines of brachiosaurus. unfortunately, owen named not one, but four separate species of bothriospondylus, some of which were shortly reassigned into (now) equally defunct genera like ornithopsis and marmarospondylus by other experts. bothriospondylus is now largely ignored by paleontologists, although a fifth species (which wasn't designated by owen) has survived as lapparentosaurus.
