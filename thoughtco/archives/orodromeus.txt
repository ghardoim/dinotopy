one of the smallest ornithopods of the late cretaceous period, orodromeus was the subject of an understandable goof by paleontologists. when this plant-eater's remains were first discovered, in a fossilized nesting ground in montana known as "egg mountain," their proximity to a clutch of eggs prompted the conclusion that those eggs belonged to orodromeus. we now know that the eggs were really laid by a female troodon, which also lived on egg mountainâ€”the inescapable conclusion being that orodromeus was hunted by these slightly larger, but much smarter, theropod dinosaurs.
