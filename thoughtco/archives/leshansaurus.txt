to date, not a lot is known about the leshansaurus (about 20 feet long, 1 ton), which was described on the basis of a partial juvenile skeleton unearthed in china's dashanpu formation in 2009. initially, this theropod was classified as a close relative of sinraptor, but there are some indications that it may have been a megalosaur instead (and thus similar to the western european megalosaurus). leshansaurus did possess an unusually narrow snout, which has fueled speculation that it preyed on the small, more easily tipped-over ankylosaurs of late cretaceous china (such as chialingosaurus).
