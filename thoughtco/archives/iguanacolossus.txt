one of the more imaginatively named ornithopod dinosaurs of the early cretaceous period, iguanacolossus was recently discovered in utah alongside the slightly later, and much smaller, hippodraco. (as you might have guessed, the "iguana" in this dinosaur's name refers to its more famous, and comparatively more advanced, relative iguanodon, and not to modern iguanas.) the most impressive thing about iguanacolossus was its sheer bulk; at 30 feet long and 2 to 3 tons, this dinosaur would have been one of the biggest non-titanosaur plant-eaters of its north american ecosystem.
