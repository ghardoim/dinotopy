patagosaurus is notable not for how it looked--this large herbivorous dinosaur adhered to the plain-vanilla sauropod body plan, with its massive trunk and long neck and tail--than for when it lived. patagosaurus is one of the few south american sauropods to date to closer to the middle than to the end of the jurassic period, living about 165 million years ago, compared to 150 million years or so for the vast majority of sauropods discovered so far. its closest relative appears to have been the north american cetiosaurus ("whale lizard").
