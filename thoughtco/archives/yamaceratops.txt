although it's a fairly obscure dinosaur, yamaceratops (it was named after the buddhist deity yama) is important for two reasons. first, this ceratopsian—a member of the same family that later gave rise to triceratops and centrosaurus—lived in asia, whereas later ceratopsians were confined to north america. and second, yamaceratops prospered tens of millions of years before its more famous descendants, during the middle rather than the late cretaceous period. considering its early place on the ceratopsian evolutionary tree, it's easy to understand yamaceratops' unusually short, primitive frill (compared to the huge, elaborate productions of later dinosaurs like chasmosaurus), not to mention its relatively small size, only about 100 pounds.
