for all intents and purposes, neovenator (25 feet long and weighing a half ton) occupied the same niche in its western european habitat as allosaurus did in north america: a large, agile, fast and fearsome theropod that predated the much bigger tyrannosaurs of the later cretaceous period. neovenator is probably the best-known and most popular carnivorous dinosaur from western europe, which (until the discovery of this genus in 1996) had to make do with historically important but frustratingly vague meat-eaters like megalosaurus. (by the way, neovenator was closely related to the impressively named megaraptor of south america, which wasn't technically a true raptor but another large theropod of the allosaurus family.)
