among the earliest of all the hadrosaurs, or duck-billed dinosaurs--roaming the woodlands of asia at least 10 million years before more famous descendants like charonosaurus--bactrosaurus is important because it possessed certain characteristics (such as a thick, squat body) more often seen in iguanodont dinosaurs. (paleontologists believe that hadrosaurs and iguanodonts, which are both technically classified as ornithopods, evolved from a common ancestor). unlike most hadrosaurs, bactrosaurus seems to have lacked a crest on its head, and it also had a row of short spines growing out of its vertebrae that formed a prominent, skin-covered ridge along its back.
