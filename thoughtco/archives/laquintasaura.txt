the first plant-eating dinosaur ever to be discovered in venezuela--and only the second dinosaur, period, since it was announced at the same time as the meat-eating tachiraptor—laquintasaura was a tiny ornithischian that prospered shortly after the triassic/jurassic boundary, 200 million years ago. what this means is that laquintasaura was only recently evolved from its carnivorous ancestors (the first dinosaurs that sprang up in south america 30 million years before)—which may explain the odd shape of this dinosaur's teeth, which seem to have been equally suited to scarfing down small insects and animals as well as the usual diet of ferns and leaves.
