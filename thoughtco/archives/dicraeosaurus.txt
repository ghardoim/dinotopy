dicraeosaurus wasn't your typical sauropod of the late jurassic period: this medium-sized ("only" 10 tons or so) plant eater had an unusually short neck and tail, and most important, a series of double-pronged bones that jutted out from the front part of its vertebral column. clearly, dicraeosaurus had prominent spines along its neck and upper back, or possibly even a sail, which would have helped to regulate its body temperature (the latter possibility is less likely, since numerous sauropods besides dicraeosaurus would have evolved sails if these had been of any adaptive value). you might not be surprised to learn that dicraeosaurus was closely related to amargasaurus, an unusually spiny-backed sauropod from south america.
