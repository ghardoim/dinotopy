at some point during the middle cretaceous period, the later ornithopods evolved into the early hadrosaurs, or duck-billed dinosaurs (technically, hadrosaurs are classified under the ornithopod umbrella). altirhinus is often pointed to as a transitional form between these two closely related dinosaur families, mostly because of the very hadrosaur-like bump on its nose, which resembles an early version of the elaborate crests of later duck-billed dinosaurs like parasaurolophus. if you ignore this growth, though, altirhinus also looked a lot like iguanodon, which is why most experts classify it as an iguanodont ornithopod rather than a true hadrosaur.
