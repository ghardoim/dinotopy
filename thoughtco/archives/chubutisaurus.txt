there's not a whole lot one can say about the early cretaceous chubutisaurus, except that it seems to have been a fairly typical south american titanosaur: a large, lightly armored, four-legged plant-eater with a long neck and tail. what gives this dinosaur an added twist is that its scattered remains were found near those of the fearsomely named tyrannotitan, a 40-foot-long theropod closely related to allosaurus. we don't know for sure if packs of tyrannotitan took down full-grown chubutisaurus adults, but it certainly makes for an arresting image!
