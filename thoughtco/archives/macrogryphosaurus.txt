you've got to admire any dinosaur whose name translates as "big enigmatic lizard"â€”a view apparently shared by the producers of the bbc series "walking with dinosaurs," who once gave macrogryphosaurus a small cameo. one of the rare ornithopods to be discovered in south america, macrogryphosaurus seems to have been closely related to the equally obscure talenkauen and is classified as a "basal" iguanodont. since the type fossil is of a juvenile, no one is quite sure how big macrogryphosaurus adults were, although three or four tons is not out of the question.
