as you may have guessed from its name—greek for "wolf snout"—lycorhinus wasn't identified as a dinosaur when its remains were first discovered way back in 1924, but as a therapsid, or "mammal-like reptile" (this was the branch of non-dinosaur reptiles that eventually evolved into true mammals during the course of the triassic period). it took nearly 40 years for paleontologists to recognize lycorhinus as an early ornithopod dinosaur closely related to heterodontosaurus, with which it shared some strangely shaped teeth (notably the two pairs of oversized canines in front of its jaws).
