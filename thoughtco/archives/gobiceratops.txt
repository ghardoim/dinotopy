most ceratopsians, or horned, frilled dinosaurs, are represented in the fossil record by truly massive skulls; for example, triceratops had one of the biggest heads of any land animal that ever lived. that's not the case for gobiceratops, which was "diagnosed" in 2008 based on the single, tiny skull of a juvenile, less than two inches wide. not much is known about how this small, herbivorous dinosaur lived, but it seems to have been related to another early ceratopsian of central asia, bagaceratops, and eventually gave rise to the giant ceratopsians of north america.
