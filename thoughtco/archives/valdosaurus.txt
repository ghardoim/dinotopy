valdosaurus was a typical ornithopod of early cretaceous europe: a small, two-legged, nimble plant-eater that was probably capable of impressive bursts of speed when it was being chased by the larger theropods of its habitat. until recently, this dinosaur was classified as a species of the better-known dryosaurus, but upon reexamination of the fossil remains, it was awarded its own genus. an "iguanodont" ornithopod, valdosaurus was closely related to, you guessed it, iguanodon. (recently, a central african species of valdosaurus was reassigned to its own genus, elrhazosaurus.)
