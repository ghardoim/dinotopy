along with its close contemporary, jingshanosaurus, yimenosaurus was one of the largest prosauropods of the mesozoic era, measuring about 30 feet from head to tail and weighing as much as two tons--not much compared to the plus-sized sauropods of the late jurassic period, but beefier than most other prosauropods, which only weighed a few hundred pounds. thanks to its numerous (and near-complete) fossil remains, yimenosaurus is one of the better known plant-eating dinosaurs of early jurassic asia, rivaled only by another chinese prosauropod, lufengosaurus.
