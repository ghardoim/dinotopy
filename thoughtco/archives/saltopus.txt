saltopus is yet another of those triassic reptiles that inhabits a "shadow zone" between the most advanced archosaurs and the earliest dinosaurs. because the single identified fossil of this creature is incomplete, experts differ about how it should be classified, some assigning it as an early theropod dinosaur and others saying it was akin to "dinosauriform" archosaurs like marasuchus, which preceded the true dinosaurs during the middle triassic period. recently, the weight of the evidence points to saltopus being a late triassic "dinosauriform" rather than a true dinosaur.
