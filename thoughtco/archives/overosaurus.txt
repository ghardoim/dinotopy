if you had a dollar for every titanosaur discovered in modern-day south america, you'd have enough for a very nice birthday present. what makes overosaurus (announced to the world in 2013) unique is that it seems to have been a "dwarf" titanosaur, measuring 30 feet from head to tail and only weighing in the neighborhood of five tons (by comparison, the much more famous argentinosaurus weighed anywhere from 50 to 100 tons). an examination of its scattered remains reveals overosaurus to be closely related to two other, larger south american titanosaurs, gondwanatitan and aeolosaurus.
