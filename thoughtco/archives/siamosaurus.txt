it's true that many dinosaurs are diagnosed on the basis of a single, fossilized tooth—but it's also true that many of these dinosaurs are looked on dubiously by other paleontologists, who require more convincing evidence. that's the case with siamosaurus (about 30 feet long and 2-3 tons), which in 1986 was touted by its discoverers as the very first spinosaur (i.e., spinosaurus-like theropod) ever to be discovered in asia. (since then, a comparably sized and better-attested spinosaur, ichthyovenator, has been unearthed in laos.) if siamosaurus was in fact a spinosaur, it probably spent most of its day on the banks of rivers hunting for fish—and if it wasn't, then it may well have been another type of large theropod with a more diverse diet.
