one doesn't normally associate south korea with major dinosaur discoveries, so you may be surprised to learn that koreanosaurus is represented by no less than three separate (but incomplete) fossil specimens, discovered in this country's seonso conglomerate in 2003. to date, not a lot has been published about koreanosaurus, which seems to have been a classic, small-bodied ornithopod of the late cretaceous period, perhaps closely related to jeholosaurus and perhaps (though this is far from proven) a burrowing dinosaur along the lines of the better-known oryctodromeus.
