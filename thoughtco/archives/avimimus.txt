despite the similarity of their names, the "bird-mimic" avimimus was very different from the "bird-mimic" ornithomimus. the latter was a large, speedy, ostrich-like dinosaur carrying a fair amount of momentum and heft, while the former was a small "dino-bird" of central asia, notable for its numerous feathers, plumed tail, and bird-like feet. what places avimimus firmly in the dinosaur category is the primitive teeth in its upper jaw, as well as its similarities to other, less bird-like oviraptors of the cretaceous period (including the poster genus for the group, oviraptor).
