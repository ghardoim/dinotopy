as with so many evolutionary transitions, there wasn't a single "aha!" moment when the most advanced ornithopods evolved into the first hadrosaurs, or duck-billed dinosaurs. in the late 1990's, protohadros was touted by its discoverer as the first-ever hadrosaur, and its name reflects his confidence in this assessment. other paleontologists, however, are less certain, and have since concluded that protohadros was an iguanodontid ornithopod, almost, but not quite, on the cusp of being a true duckbill. not only is this a more sober assessment of the evidence, but it leaves intact the current theory that the first true hadrosaurs evolved in asia rather than north america (the type specimen of protohadros was unearthed in texas.)
