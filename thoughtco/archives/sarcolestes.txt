sarcolestes is one of the most spectacularly misnamed of all dinosaurs: the moniker of this proto-ankylosaur means "flesh thief," and was bestowed by nineteenth-century paleontologists who thought they had unearthed the incomplete fossil of a carnivorous theropod. (actually, "incomplete" may be an understatement: all we know of this poky herbivore has been extrapolated from part of a jawbone.) still, sarcolestes is important for being one of the earliest armored dinosaurs yet discovered, dating to the late jurassic period, about 160 million years ago. it isn't technically classified as an ankylosaur, but paleontologists believe if may have been ancestral to that spiky breed.
