a close relative of iguanodon—in fact, when this dinosaur's remains were discovered in spain in 1958, they were initially assigned to iguanodon bernissartensis—delapparentia was even bigger than its more famous relative, about 27 feet from head to tail and weighing upwards of four or five tons. delapparentia was only assigned its own genus in 2011, its name, oddly enough, honoring the paleontologist who misidentified the type fossil, albert-felix de lapparent. its twisted taxonomy aside, delapparentia was a typical ornithopod of the early cretaceous period, an ungainly looking plant-eater that may have been capable of running on its hind legs when startled by predators.
