there wasn't much special about the appearance of sonorasaurus, which adhered to the basic body plan of brachiosaurus-like sauropods: an extremely long neck and a thick trunk supported by significantly longer front than back legs. what makes sonorosaurus interesting is that its remains date from middle cretaceous north america (about 100 million years ago), a relatively sparse stretch of time when it comes to sauropod fossils. by the way, the euphonious name of this dinosaur derives from arizona's sonora desert, a popular tourist destination to this day.
