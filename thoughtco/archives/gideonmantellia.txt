when the name gideonmantellia was coined in 2006, the 19th-century naturalist gideon mantell became one of the few people to have not one, not two, but three dinosaurs named after him, the others being mantellisaurus and the somewhat more dubious mantellodon. confusingly, gideonmantellia and mantellisaurus lived at about the same time (the early cretaceous period) and in the same ecosystem (the woodlands of western europe), and they're both classified as ornithopods closely related to iguanodon. why does gideon mantell deserve this double honor? well, in his own lifetime, he was overshadowed by more powerful and self-centered paleontologists like richard owen, and modern researchers feel that he's been unjustly overlooked by history.
