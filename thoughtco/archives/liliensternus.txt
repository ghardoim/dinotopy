as dinosaur names go, liliensternus doesn't exactly inspire fear, sounding more like it belongs to a gentle librarian than to a fearsome carnivorous dinosaur of the triassic period. however, this close relative of other early theropods like coelophysis and dilophosaurus was one of the largest predators of its time, with long, five-fingered hands, an impressive head crest, and a bipedal posture that must have allowed it to reach respectable speeds in pursuit of prey. it probably fed on relatively small, herbivorous dinosaurs like sellosaurus and efraasia.
