just how confident was the famous paleontologist robert bakker when the discovered the fossils of edmarka in the early 1990s? well, he dubbed this presumed new species of large theropod edmarka rex, after its more famous cousin of the late cretaceous period, tyrannosaurus rex. the trouble is, most paleontologists believe that edmarka rex was actually in the genus torvosaurus. whatever you choose to call it, edmarka (35 feet long and 2-3 tons) was clearly an apex predator of late jurassic north america, and one of the scariest predatory dinosaurs until the advent of full-sized tyrannosaurs tens of millions of years later.
