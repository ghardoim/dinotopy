einiosaurus was distinguished from its more famous cousins (like centrosaurus and triceratops) by the single, downward-curving horn jutting out from the middle of its snout. the discovery of numerous bones jumbled together (representing at least 15 separate individuals) indicates that this dinosaur may have traveled in herds, at least one of which reached a catastrophic endâ€”possibly when all the members drowned while trying to cross a flooding river.
