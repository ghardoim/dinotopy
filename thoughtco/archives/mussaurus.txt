the name mussaurus ("mouse lizard") is a bit of a misnomer: when the famous paleontologist jose bonaparte discovered this argentinean dinosaur in the 1970's, the only skeletons he identified were of newly hatched juveniles, which measured a mere foot or so from head to tail. later, bonaparte established that these hatchlings were actually prosauropods--distant triassic cousins of the gigantic sauropods of the late jurassic period--that grew to lengths of about 10 feet and weights of 200 to 300 pounds, much bigger than any mouse you're likely to encounter today!
