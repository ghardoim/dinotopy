judging by its single, incomplete specimen, zupaysaurus appears to have been one of the earliest theropods, the two-legged, carnivorous dinosaurs of the late triassic and early jurassic periods that eventually evolved into giant beasts like tyrannosaurus rex a hundred million years later. at 13 feet long and 500 pounds, zupaysaurus was fairly large for its time and place (most other theropods of the triassic period were about the size of chickens), and based on which reconstruction you believe, it may or may not have had a pair of dilophosaurus-like crests running down the top of its snout.
