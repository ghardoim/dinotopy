a huge number of titanosaurs--the lightly armored descendants of the sauropods--have been discovered in south america, but most of them are known from frustratingly incomplete fossil remains. aeolosaurus is comparatively well-represented in the fossil record, with near-complete spine and leg bones and scattered "scutes" (the tough pieces of skin used for armor plating). most intriguingly, the spines on aeolosaurus' tail vertebrae point forward, a hint that this 10-ton herbivore may have been capable of rearing up on its hind legs to nibble on the tops of tall trees. (by the way, the name aeolosaurus derives from aeolus, the ancient greek "keeper of the winds," in reference to the windy conditions in south america's patagonia region.)
