like many theropods (the large family of two-legged carnivorous dinosaurs that included such diverse groups as raptors, tyrannosaurs, carnosaurs, and allosaurs), fukuiraptor (about 13 feet long and about 300 pounds) has bounced around the classification bins ever since its discovery in japan. at first, this dinosaur's giant hand claws were misidentified as belonging on its feet, and it was classified as a raptor (a legacy that endures in its name). today, though, fukuiraptor is believed to have been a carnosaur and was probably closely related to another misnamed, medium-size theropod, the chinese sinraptor. during the middle cretaceous period, it's possible that fukuiraptor preyed on the contemporary ornithopod fukuisaurus, but as yet, there's no evidence for this.
