discovered near the yellow river in china in 2004, and described two years later, huanghetitan was a classic titanosaur: the enormous, lightly armored, quadrupedal dinosaurs that had a worldwide distribution throughout the cretaceous period. to judge by this plant-eater's ten-foot-long ribs, huanghetitan possessed one of the deepest body cavities of any titanosaur yet identified, and this (combined with its length) has led some paleontologists to nominate it as one of the largest dinosaurs that ever lived. we don't quite know that for sure, but we do know that huanghetitan was closely related to another asian colossus, daxiatitan.
