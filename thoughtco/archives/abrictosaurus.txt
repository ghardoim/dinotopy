as with many dinosaurs, abrictosaurus is known from limited remains, the incomplete fossils of two individuals. this dinosaur's distinctive teeth mark it as a close relative of heterodontosaurus, and like many reptiles of the early jurassic period, it was fairly small, adults reaching sizes of only 100 pounds or so--and it may have existed at the time of the ancient split between ornithischian and saurischian dinosaurs. based on the presence of primitive tusks in one specimen of abrictosaurus, it's believed this species may have been sexually dimorphic, with males differing from females.
