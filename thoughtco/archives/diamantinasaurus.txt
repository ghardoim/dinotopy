titanosaurs, the armored descendants of the sauropods, could be found all over the world during the cretaceous period. the latest example from australia is diamantinasaurus, which is represented by a fairly complete, albeit headless, fossil specimen. aside from its basic body shape, no one knows exactly what diamantinasaurus looked like, although (like other titanosaurs) its back was probably lined with scaly armor plating. if its scientific name (which means "diamantina river lizard") is too much of a mouthful, you may want to call this dinosaur by its australian nickname, matilda.
