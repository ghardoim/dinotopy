beipiaosaurus is yet another of those strange dinosaurs in the therizinosaur family: long-clawed, pot-bellied, two-legged, plant-eating theropods (most of the theropods of the mesozoic era were devoted carnivores) that seem to have been constructed from bits and pieces of other types of dinosaurs. beipiaosaurus appears to have been slightly brainier than its cousins (to judge by its slightly larger skull), and it's the only therizinosaur proven to have sported feathers, though it's highly probable that other genera did as well. its closest relative was the slightly earlier therizinosaur falcarius.
