sinusonasus must have been standing behind the door when all the cool dinosaur names were being handed out. it sounds like a painful disease, or at least a bothersome head cold, but this was actually an early feathered dinosaur closely related to the more famous (and much later) troodon. judging by the single fossil specimen found so far, this feathered theropod appears to have been well-adapted to pursuing and eating a wide variety of small prey, ranging from insects to lizards to (possibly) other small dinosaurs of the early cretaceous period.
