one of the largest prosauropods--the herbivorous, four-footed, distant uncles of the later sauropods--ever to walk the earth, jingshanosaurus tipped the scales at a respectable one to two tons and was about 30 feet long (by comparison, most prosauropods of the early jurassic period only weighed a few hundred pounds). as you might guess from its advanced size, jingshanosaurus was also among the last of the prosauropods, an honor it shares with its fellow asian plant-eater yunnanosaurus. (it may yet be the case that jingshanosaurus will be reassigned as a species of this more well-known prosauropod, pending further fossil evidence.)
