panoplosaurus was a typical nodosaur, a family of armored dinosaurs included under the ankylosaur umbrella: basically, this plant-eater looked like a huge paperweight, with its small head, short legs and tail sprouting out of a stocky, well-armored trunk. like others of its kind, panoplosaurus would have been virtually immune to predation by the hungry raptors and tyrannosaurs populating late cretaceous north america; the only way these carnivores could hope to get a quick meal was by somehow tipping this heavy, ponderous, none-too-bright creature onto its back and digging into its soft belly. (by the way, the closest relative of panopolosaurus was the better-known armored dinosaur edmontonia.)
