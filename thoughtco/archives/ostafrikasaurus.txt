no paleontologist likes to erect a new dinosaur genus on the basis of a handful of teeth, but sometimes that's all there is to go on, and you have to make the best of the situation. ostafrikasaurus has bounced all over the classification bins since its discovery in tanzania in the early 20th century. first, it was assigned to labrosaurus (which turned out to be the same dinosaur as allosaurus), then to ceratosaurus, and then to an early spinosaur closely related to spinosaurus and baryonyx. if this last identification holds, then ostafrikasaurus will prove to be the earliest spinosaur in the fossil record, dating to the late jurassic (rather than the early to middle cretaceous) period.
