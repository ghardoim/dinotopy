one of the more recent oviraptor-like dinosaurs to be discovered in central asia, heyuannnia differs from its mongolian relatives in having actually been unearthed in china proper. this small, bipedal, feathered theropod was distinguished by its unusual hands (with their small, blunt first digits), comparably small arms, and lack of a head crest. like its fellow oviraptors (and also like modern birds), the females probably sat on clutches of eggs until they hatched. as to heyuannia's precise evolutionary relationship to the dozens of other oviraptors of late cretaceous asia, that remains a subject of further study.
