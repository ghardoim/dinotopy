only "diagnosed" in 2009 based on two juvenile skeletons, aardonyx was an early example of a prosauropod--the plant-eating precursors of the huge sauropods of the late jurassic period. what makes aardonyx important from an evolutionary perspective is that it seemed to pursue a mostly bipedal lifestyle, dropping occasionally to all fours to feed (or perhaps mate). as such, it captures an "intermediate" stage between the lighter, bipedal herbivorous dinosaurs of the early and middle jurassic periods and the heavier, quadrupedal plant eaters that evolved later.
