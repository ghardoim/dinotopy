ingenia wasn't any more ingenious than the other dinosaurs of its time and place; its name derives from the ingen region of central asia, where it was discovered in the mid-1970's. very few fossils of this small, feathered theropod have been identified, but (from the location of nearby nesting grounds) we know that ingenia hatched clutches of two dozen eggs at a time. its nearest relative was another dinosaur that kept in close contact with its young before and after they hatched, oviraptor--which itself has lent its name to a huge family of central asian "oviraptorosaurs."
