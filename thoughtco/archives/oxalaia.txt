if paleontologists had discovered oxalaia's arm or leg, rather than pieces of its long, narrow snout, they probably wouldn't have been able to classify this dinosaur. as things stand, though, oxalaia was clearly a genus of spinosaur, the family of plus-sized meat eaters characterized by their crocodile-ish jaws and (in some species) the sails on their backs. to date, the oxalaia (about 40 feet long and 6 tons) is the largest spinosaur to be discovered in south america, bigger than its continent-mates irritator and angaturama but slightly smaller than african spinosaurs like suchomimus and (of course) spinosaurus.
