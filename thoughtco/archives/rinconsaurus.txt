not all titanosaurs were equally titanic. a case in point is rinconsaurus, which measured only 35 feet from head to tail and weighed about five tons--in stark contrast to the 100-ton weights achieved by other south american titanosaurs (notably argentinosaurus, which was also lived in argentina during the middle to late cretaceous period). clearly, the shrimpy rinconsaurus evolved to feed on a particular type of low-to-the-ground vegetation, which it stripped with its numerous, chisel-like teeth; its closest relatives appear to have been aeolosaurus and gondwanatitan.
