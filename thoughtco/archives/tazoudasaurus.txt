the very first sauropods, such as antetonitrus and isanosaurus, evolved on earth around the triassic/jurassic boundary. discovered in 2004, tazoudasaurus dates from the far end of that boundary, the early jurassic period, and is represented in the fossil record by the earliest intact skull of any sauropod. as you might expect, tazoudasaurus retained some of the characteristics of its prosauropod ancestors, especially in its jaws and teeth, and at 30 feet long it was a relative runt compared to its descendants of the later jurassic. its closest relative appears to have been the slightly later vulcanodon.
