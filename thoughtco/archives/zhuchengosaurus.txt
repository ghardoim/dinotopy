the impact of zhuchengosaurus on the dinosaur record books has yet to be determined. paleontologists aren't quite certain if this 55-foot-long, 15-ton plant-eater should be classified as a gigantic, iguanodon-like ornithopod, or as one of the first true hadrosaurs. if it winds up in the latter category, the early-to-middle cretaceous zhuchengosaurus would supplant shantungosaurus (which roamed asia over 30 million years later) as the biggest hadrosaur that ever lived! (addendum: after further study, paleontologists have concluded that zhuchengosaurus was really a species of shantungosaurus after all.)
