a mere 20 million years or so before enormous ceratopsians (horned, frilled dinosaurs) like triceratops developed, smaller species such as t he 400-pound cerasinops roamed north america. although cerasinops was nowhere near as small as "basal" ceratopsians like psittacosaurus that preceded it by tens of millions of years, it had many anatomical characteristics in common with these early plant-eaters, including an unobtrusive frill, a prominent beak and, possibly, a bipedal posture. the closest relative of cerasinops appears to have been leptoceratops, but otherwise, this ceratopsian is still poorly understood.
