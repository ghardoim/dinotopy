to a lesser or greater extent, all sauropods looked pretty much like all other sauropods. what makes jobaria such an important find is that this plant-eater was so primitive compared to others of its breed that some paleontologists wonder if it was a true sauropod at all, or better classified as a "neosauropod" or "eusauropod." of particular interest are jobaria's vertebrae, which were simpler than those of other sauropods, and its unusually short tail. further complicating matters, it's unclear if this herbivore dates to the early cretaceous period (it was assigned to this time frame based on a nearby fossil of afrovenator), or instead lived in the late jurassic.
