ankylosaurs were some of the last dinosaurs standing before the k/t extinction 65 million years ago, but talarurus was one of the earliest members of the breed, dating to about 30 million years before the dinosaurs went kaput. talarurus wasn't huge by the standards of later ankylosaurs like ankylosaurus and euoplocephalus, but it still would have been a tough nut to crack for the average tyrannosaur or raptor, a low-slung, heavily armored plant eater with a clubbed, swinging tail (this dinosaur's name, greek for "wicker tail," derives from the wicker-like tendons that stiffened its tail and helped make it such a deadly weapon).
