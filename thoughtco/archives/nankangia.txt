chinese paleontologists have a lot of work cut out for them, as they attempt to distinguish among the various oviraptor-like, late cretaceous "dino-birds" that have recently been discovered in their country. unearthed in the vicinity of three similar theropods (two of which have been named, and one of which remains unidentified), nankangia seems to have been largely herbivorous, and probably spent a fair amount of its time evading the attention of larger tyrannosaurs and raptors. its closest relatives were probably the (much bigger) gigantoraptor and the (much smaller) yulong.
