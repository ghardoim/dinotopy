marshosaurus didn't earn its name because it lived in a marshy habitat; rather, it honors the famous paleontologist othniel c. marsh, who's also memorialized by another dinosaur genus (othnielia, sometimes called othnielosaurus). beyond its illustrious name, marshosaurus (20 feet long, 1,000 pounds) appears to have been a typical, medium-sized theropod of the late jurassic period and is represented by very limited fossil remains. this would no doubt displease marsh, a famously prickly figure who spent much of the 19th century feuding with his contemporary, edward drinker cope, on a dark page of dinosaur history known as the bone wars.
