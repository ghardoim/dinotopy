the full name of hagryphus is hagryphus giganteus, which should tell you everything you need to know about this oviraptor-like theropod: this was one of the biggest feathered dinosaurs of late cretaceous north america (up to 8 feet long and 100 pounds) and also one of the fastest, probably capable of hitting top speeds of 30 miles an hour. although comparably sized oviraptors have been discovered in central asia, to date, hagryphus is the largest of its breed known to have inhabited the new world, the next-biggest example being the 50- to 75-pound chirostenotes. (by the way, the name hagryphus derives from the native american god ha and the mythological, bird-like creature known as the griffin.)
