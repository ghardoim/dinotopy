when its skull was first discovered--in england way back in 1910--proceratosaurus was thought to have been related to the similarly crested ceratosaurus, which lived much later. today, though, paleontologists identify this middle-jurassic predator as more similar to small, early theropods like coelurus and compsognathus. despite its relatively small size, the 500-pound proceratosaurus was one of the biggest hunters of its day, since the tyrannosaurs and other large theropods of the middle jurassic had yet to attain their maximum sizes.
