although it was described and named by the famous chinese paleontologist dong zhiming, magnirostris may or may not deserve its own genus. most experts believe this dinosaur was actually a juvenile of a similar ceratopsian of late cretaceous mongolia, bagaceratops, and it may even conceivably have been a species of protoceratops. however this dinosaur winds up being classified, the skull of magnirostris is one of the best-preserved in the (small) ceratopsian fossil record, with a sharp, horny, roughly triangular beak that must have come in handy for shearing off tough vegetation.
