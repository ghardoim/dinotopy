more so than the still-mysterious titanosaurus, malawisaurus can arguably be considered the "type specimen" for titanosaurs, the lightly armored descendants of the giant sauropods of the jurassic period. malawisaurus is one of the few titanosaurs for which we have direct evidence of a skull (albeit only a partial one that includes most of the upper and lower jaw), and fossilized scutes have been found in the vicinity of its remains, evidence of the armor plating that once lined this herbivore's neck and back. incidentally, malawisaurus was once considered a species of the now-invalid genus gigantosaurus--not to be confused with giganotosaurus (note that extra "o"), which wasn't a titanosaur at all but a large theropod.
