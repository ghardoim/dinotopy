one of the few large theropods to be discovered in portugal, lourinhanosaurus (about 20 feet long and a couple of tons) was named after that country's lourinha formation, and it has proven difficult to classify. paleontologists can't decide if it was most closely related to allosaurus, sinraptor or the equally obscure megalosaurus. this late jurassic predator is noteworthy for two reasons: first, scientists have identified gastroliths among its fossilized stomach contents, which lourinhanosaurus clearly swallowed on purpose rather than ingesting by accident when eating herbivorous dinosaurs. and second, a clutch of about 100 lourinhanosaurus eggs, some containing fossilized embryos, have been found close to the original excavation site.
