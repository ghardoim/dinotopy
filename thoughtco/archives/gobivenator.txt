small, feathered dinosaurs were thick on the ground in late cretaceous central asia, especially in the stretch of territory now occupied by the gobi desert. announced to the world in 2014, on the basis of a single, near-complete fossil discovered in mongolia's flaming cliffs formation, gobivenator competed for prey with such familiar dinosaurs as velociraptor and oviraptor. (gobivenator wasn't technically a raptor, but rather a close relative of another famous feathered dinosaur, troodon). how, you may wonder, could all of these feathered hunters have survived in the austere environs of the gobi desert? well, 75 million years ago, this region was a lush, forested landscape, stocked with enough lizards, amphibians and even small mammals to keep the average dinosaur sated.
