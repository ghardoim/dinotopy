from a distance of 75 million years, it can be hard to distinguish one armored dinosaur from another. scolosaurus had the misfortune of living in a time and place (late cretaceous alberta, canada) that was rife with ankylosaurs, which in 1971 prompted a frustrated paleontologist to "synonymize" three species: anodontosaurus lambei, dyoplosaurus acutosquameus and scolosaurus cutleri all wound up being assigned to the better-known euoplocephalus. however, a recent reexamination of the evidence by canadian researchers concludes that not only do dyoplosaurus and scolosaurus deserve their own genus designation, but the latter should rightly take precedence over euoplocephalus.
