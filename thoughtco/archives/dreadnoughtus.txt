don't let the headlines fool you; dreadnoughtus isn't the biggest dinosaur ever to be discovered, not by a long shot. it is, however, the largest dinosaur--specifically, a titanosaur--for which we have indisputable fossil evidence of its length and weight, the bones of two separate individuals allowing researchers to piece together 70 percent of its "type fossil." (other titanosaur genera that lived in the same region of late cretaceous argentina, such as argentinosaurus and futalognkosaurus, were indisputably bigger than dreadnoughtus, but their restored skeletons are far less complete.) you have to admit, though, that this dinosaur has been given an impressive name, after the gigantic, armored "dreadnought" battleships of the early 20th century.
