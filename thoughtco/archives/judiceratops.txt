judiceratops was named in 2013 after the judith river formation in montana where its "type fossil" was discovered. judiceratops' claim to fame is that it's the earliest "chasmosaurine" dinosaur yet identified, ancestral to the better-known chasmosaurus that lived a few million years laterâ€”a kinship you can instantly detect in these two dinosaurs' distinctively ornamented frills.
