technically a nodosaur rather than an ankylosaur—meaning that it lacked a bony club at the end of its tail—peloroplites was one of the largest armored dinosaurs of the middle cretaceous period, almost 20 feet from head to tail and weighing as much as three tons. discovered in utah in 2008, this plant-eater's name honors the ancient greek hoplites, the heavily armored soldiers depicted in the movie 300 (another ankylosaur, hoplitosaurus, also shares this distinction). peloroplites shared the same territory as cedarpelta and animantarx and seems to have specialized in eating especially tough vegetation.
