considering how obscure it is, dysalotosaurus has a lot to teach us about dinosaur growth stages. various specimens of this medium-sized herbivore have been discovered in africa, enough for paleontologists to conclude that a) dysalotosaurus reached maturity in a relatively quick 10 years, b) this dinosaur was subject to viral infections of its skeleton, similar to padget's disease, and c) the brain of dysalotosaurus went through major structural changes between early childhood and maturity, though its auditory centers were well-developed early on. otherwise, though, dysalotosaurus was a plain-vanilla plant eater, indistinguishable from the other ornithopods of its time and place.
