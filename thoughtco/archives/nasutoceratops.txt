nasutoceratops, first identified in 2013, was distinguished from others of its kind by its unusually large nose and the remarkably steer-like pair of horns jutting out from over its eyes. on the other hand, the frill of nasutoceratops was nothing special, lacking the elaborate notches, ridges, fringes, and decorations of other ceratopsians. as with other dinosaurs, nasutoceratops likely evolved its facial characteristics as a means of intra-species recognition and sexual differentiationâ€”(that is, males with bigger noses and straighter horns were more attractive to females.
