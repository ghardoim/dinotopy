just how much did philovenator "love to hunt?" well, like the numerous other feathered theropods that prowled central asia during the late cretaceous period, this two-legged "dino-bird" spent its days feasting on small lizards, insects, and any other pint-sized theropods unfortunate enough to venture in its immediate vicinity. when it was first discovered, philovenator was classified as a juvenile specimen of the better-known saurornithoides, then as a close cousin of linhevenator, and was finally granted its own genus (its species name, curriei, honors the globetrotting paleontologist philip j. currie).
