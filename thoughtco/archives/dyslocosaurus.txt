in paleontology, it's very, very important to record exactly where you've found a given dinosaur skeleton. unfortunately, this rule wasn't followed by the fossil hunter who unearthed dyslocosaurus decades ago; he merely wrote "lance creek" on his specimen, leaving succeeding experts unsure whether he was referring to the lance creek region of wyoming or (more probably) the lance formation in the same state. the name dyslocosaurus ("hard-to-place lizard") was bestowed on this presumed sauropod by frustrated paleontologists, at least one of whom--the ubiquitous paul sereno--thinks that dyslocosaurus was actually assembled out of two very different dinosaurs, a titanosaur and a large theropod.
