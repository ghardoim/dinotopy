as a rule, any dinosaur that lived in western europe during the cretaceous period had its counterpart somewhere in asia (and often in north america as well). the importance of taohelong, announced in 2013, is that it's the first identified "polacanthine" ankylosaur from asia, meaning this armored dinosaur was a close relative of the better-known polacanthus of europe. technically, taohelong was a nodosaur rather than an ankylosaur, and lived at a time when these armored plant-eaters had yet to evolve the giant sizes (and impressively knobby ornamentation) of their late cretaceous descendants.
