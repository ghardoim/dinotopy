the large theropods of early cretaceous north america, about 125 million years ago, needed a reliable source of prey, and no prey was more reliable than squat, bulky, ungainly ornithopods like planicoxa. this "iguanodontid" ornithopod (so named because it was closely related to iguanodon) wasn't entirely defenseless, especially when full grown, but it must have been quite a sight when it bolted away from predators on two feet after quietly grazing in its usual quadrupedal posture. one species of a related ornithopod, camptosaurus, has been assigned to planicoxa, while one planicoxa species has since been stripped away to erect the genus osmakasaurus.
