like the armored dinosaur hylaeosaurus, kritosaurus is more important from a historical than from a paleontological point of view. this hadrosaur was discovered in 1904 by the famous fossil hunter barnum brown, and an awful lot was inferred about its appearance and behavior based on very limited remains--to the extent that the pendulum has now swung the other way and very few experts talk with any confidence about kritosaurus. for what it's worth, the type specimen of kritosaurus will almost certainly wind up being assigned to a more solidly established genus of a hadrosaur.
