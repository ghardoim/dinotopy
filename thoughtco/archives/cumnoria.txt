an entire book can be written about the dinosaurs that were mistakenly classified as species of iguanodon in the late 19th century. cumnoria is a good example: when this ornithopod's "type fossil" was unearthed from england's kimmeridge clay formation, it was assigned as an iguanodon species by an oxford paleontologist, in 1879 (at a time when the full extent of ornithopod diversity was not yet known). a few years later, harry seeley erected the new genus cumnoria (after the hill where the bones were discovered), but he was overturned shortly thereafter by yet another paleontologist, who lumped cumnoria in with camptosaurus. the matter was finally settled over a century later, in 1998, when cumnoria was once again granted its own genus after a reexamination of its remains.
