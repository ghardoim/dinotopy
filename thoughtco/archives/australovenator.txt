australovenator was a third of a trio of australian dinosaurs that had been announced in 2009, the other two being huge, herbivorous titanosaurs. this dinosaur has been classified as an allosaur, a distinctive type of large theropod, and it seems to have been a lightly built, sleek predator (the paleontologist who named it has likened it to a modern cheetah). australovenator (about 20 feet long and a few hundred pounds) was unlikely to have hunted the 10-ton titanosaurs it was discovered near, but it probably made a good living off the smaller plant eaters of middle cretaceous australia. it is now believed that australovenator was a close relative of the impressively named megaraptor, a large theropod from south america.)
