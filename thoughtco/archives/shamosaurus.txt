along with the better-known gobisaurus, shamosaurus is one of the earliest identified ankylosaurs, or armored dinosaurs--captured at a crucial juncture in geologic time (the middle cretaceous period) when ornithischian plant-eaters needed to evolve some form of defense against vicious raptors and tyrannosaurs. (confusingly, shamosaurus and gobisaurus have essentially the same name; "shamo" is the mongolian name for the gobi desert.) not a whole lot is known about this armored dinosaur, a situation that will hopefully improve with further fossil discoveries.
