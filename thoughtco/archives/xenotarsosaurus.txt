paleontologists aren't quite sure what to make of xenotarsosaurus (about 20 feet long and weighing 1 ton), beyond the fact that it was a large theropod dinosaur of late cretaceous south america. tentatively, it was classified as an abelisaur. its stunted arms bear some resemblance to those of the much better known carnotaurus. however, there's also a case to be made that xenotarsosaurus was an allosaur rather than an abelisaur, and was thus more closely related to the north american allosaurus (which lived tens of millions of years earlier). whatever the case, associated fossil remains imply that xenotarsosaurus preyed on secernosaurus, the first hadrosaur ever to be identified in south america.
