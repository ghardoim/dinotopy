like many dinosaurs with "raptor" in their names, pneumatoraptor was probably not a true raptor, or dromaeosaur, but rather one of the innumerable small, feathered "dino-birds" that prowled the landscape of late cretaceous europe. as befitting its name, greek for "air thief," what we know about pneumatoraptor is airy and insubstantial: not only can't we be sure what group of theropods it belonged to, but it's represented in the fossil record by a single shoulder girdle. (for the record, the "air" part of its name refers to the hollow portions of this bone, which would have been light and birdlike in real life.)
