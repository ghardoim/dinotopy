spinostropheus (about 12 feet long and 300 pounds) is more interesting for what it reveals about how paleontology works than for how it lived (details of which are rather vague, anyway). for years, this small, two-legged dinosaur of the late jurrasic period was thought to be a species of elaphrosaurus, a genus of early theropod closely allied with ceratosaurus. then, a further study classified it as an early abelisaur (and thus more closely related to large theropods like abelisaurus). and upon even further examination, it was classified once more as a close relative of, but distinct genus from, elaphrosaurus and given its present name. any questions?
