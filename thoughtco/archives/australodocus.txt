the name australodocus will prompt two associations in the mind of the average dinosaur fan, one true and one mistaken. the true one: yes, this sauropod was named in reference to the north american diplodocus, to which it was closely related. the mistaken one: the "australo" in this dinosaur's name doesn't refer to australia; rather, it's greek for "southern," as in southern africa. the limited remains of australodocus were discovered in the same tanzanian fossil beds that have yielded a number of other late jurassic sauropods, including giraffatitan (which may well have been a species of brachiosaurus) and janenschia.
