hongshanosaurus was very similar to psittacosaurus without actually being a species of psittacosaurus: this early cretaceous ceratopsian (horned, frilled dinosaur) was distinguished from its more famous contemporary only by the distinctive shape of its skull. like psittacosaurus, hongshanosaurus didn't bear much of a resemblance to its descendants tens of millions of years down the line like triceratops and centrosaurus. in fact, it had many features in common with the small, two-legged ornithopods from which it evolved.
