its name is certainly more distinctive, but taxonomically speaking, khaan was closely related to fellow oviraptors (small, feathered theropods) like oviraptor and conchoraptor (this dinosaur was originally mistaken for another central asian oviraptor, ingenia). what makes khaan special are the completeness of its fossil remains and its unusually blunt skull, which appears to be more "primitive," or basal, than those of its oviraptor cousins. like all of the small, feathered theropods of the mesozoic era, khaan represents yet another intermediate stage in the slow evolution of dinosaurs into birds.
