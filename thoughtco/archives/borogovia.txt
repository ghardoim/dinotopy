borogovia is one of those obscure dinosaurs that's more notable for its name than for any other specific feature. this small, probably feathered theropod of late cretaceous asia, which appears to have been closely related to the much more famous troodon, was christened after the borogoves in lewis carroll's nonsense poem jabberwocky ("all mimsy were the borogoves...") since borogovia was "diagnosed" based on a single fossilized limb, it's possible that it may eventually be reassigned as a species (or individual) of a different dinosaur genus.
