as you've probably guessed, probactrosaurus was named in reference to bactrosaurus, a well-known hadrosaur of late cretaceous asia. unlike its more famous namesake, though, probactrosaurus' status as a true hadrosaur remains in some doubt: technically, this dinosaur has been described as an "iguanodont hadrosauroid," a mouthful that simply means it was perched midway between the iguanodon-like ornithopods of the early cretaceous period and the classic hadrosaurs that appeared millions of years later.
