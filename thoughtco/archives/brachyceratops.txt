paleontologists have only unearthed the remains of five-foot-long juveniles of this genus, and incomplete ones at that, the "type specimen" hailing from the two medicine formation in montana. based on what has been pieced together so far, brachyceratops appears to have been a fairly typical ceratopsian, with the massive, horned and frilled face characteristic of the breed. however, it's possible that brachyceratops may one day be assigned as a new species of an existing genus of ceratopsian, especially if it turns out that juveniles changed their appearance as they aged.
