titanosaurs--the lightly armored descendants of the sauropods--were astonishingly widespread during the cretaceous period, to the extent that just about every country on earth can lay claim to its own titanosaur genus. thailand's entry in the titanosaur sweepstakes is phuwiangosaurus, which in some ways (long neck, light armor) was a typical member of the breed, but in others (narrow teeth, strangely shaped vertebrae) stood apart from the pack. one possible explanation for the distinctive anatomy of phuwiangosaurus is that this dinosaur lived in a part of southeast asia that was separated from the bulk of eurasia during the early cretaceous period; its closest relative seems to have been nemegtosaurus.
