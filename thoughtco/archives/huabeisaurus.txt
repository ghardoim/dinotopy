paleontologists are still trying to figure out the evolutionary relationships of the numerous sauropods and titanosaurs of the later mesozoic era. discovered in northern china in 2000, huabeisaurus won't allay any of the confusion: the paleontologists who described this dinosaur maintain that it belongs to an entirely new family of titanosaurs, while other experts note its similarity to controversial sauropods like opisthocoelicaudia. however it winds up being classified, huabeisaurus was clearly one of the bigger dinosaurs of late cretaceous asia, which probably used its extra-long neck to nibble the high leaves of trees.
