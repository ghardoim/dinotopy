paleontologists are still untangling the confusion generated by the early discovery (in 1676) of megalosaurus, after which every dinosaur that vaguely resembled it was assigned, incorrectly, to its genus. a good example is magnosaurus, which (based on its limited fossil remains) was considered to be a valid species of megalosaurus until years later. apart from this taxonomic confusion, magnosaurus appears to have been a typical theropod of the middle jurassic period, relatively small (about 13 feet long and 400 pounds or so) and speedy compared to its later jurassic and cretaceous descendants.
