efraasia is one of those dinosaurs that paleontologists would rather file in a back cabinet, in some dusty museum, and forget. this triassic-period herbivore has been misidentified a record number of times--first as a crocodilian, then as a specimen of thecodontosaurus, and finally as a juvenile sellosaurus. by 2000 or so, efraasia had been conclusively identified as an early prosauropod, the evolutionary branch it occupied eventually giving rise to the giant sauropods of the late jurassic period. this dinosaur is named after eberhard fraas, the german paleontologist who first unearthed its fossil.
