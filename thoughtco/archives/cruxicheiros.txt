if the cruxicheiros fossil had been discovered 200 years ago, this large-sized dinosaur would no doubt have been classified as a species of megalosaurus. as it is, though, this dinosaur's bones were dredged from an english quarry in the early 1960s, and it was only assigned to its own genus in 2010. (note: the name cruxicheiros, "crossed hands," doesn't refer to this meat eater's posture, but to the cross hands quarry in warwickshire, england.) beyond that, not a whole lot is known about cruxicheiros besides its very general classification as a "tetanuran" theropod, meaning it was related to virtually every other meat-eating dinosaur of the mesozoic era.
