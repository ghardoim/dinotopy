the abelisaurids were a family of meat-eating dinosaurs that populated south america during the cretaceous period (the most famous member of the breed was carnotaurus). the importance of eoabelisaurus is that it's the first identified abelisaurid theropod to date from the jurassic period, about 170 million years ago, an otherwise sparse stretch of time for dinosaur discoveries. like its descendants, tens of millions of years down the line, this "dawn abelisaurus" (about 20 feet long and 1-2 tons) was characterized by its fearsome size (at least by middle jurassic standards) and its unusually stunted arms, which doubtless still served some useful purpose.
