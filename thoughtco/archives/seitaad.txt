seitaad is one of those dinosaurs that's more famous for how it died than for how it lived: the near-complete fossil of this deer-sized reptile (lacking only the head and tail) was found curled up in a way that indicates it was buried alive in a sudden avalanche, or possibly caught inside a collapsing sand dune. aside from its dramatic demise, seitaad is important for being one of the earliest prosauropods yet discovered in north america. prosauropods (or sauropodomorphs, as they're also called) were small, occasionally bipedal herbivores that were distantly ancestral to the giant sauropods of the late jurassic period, and coexisted with the earliest theropods.
