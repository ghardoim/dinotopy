for reasons that remain mysterious, very few ornithopods—the family of small, bipedal, plant-eating dinosaurs—have been discovered in south america. anabisetia (named after the archaeologist ana biset) is the best-attested of this select group, with a complete skeleton, lacking only the head, reconstructed from four separate fossil specimens. anabisetia was closely related to its fellow south american ornithopod, gasparinisaura, and probably to the more obscure notohypsilophodon as well. judging by the profusion of large, carnivorous theropods that prowled late cretaceous south america, anabisetia must have been a very fast (and very nervous) dinosaur.
