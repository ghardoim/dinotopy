as far as paleontologists can tell, the very first hadrosaurs, or duck-billed dinosaurs, evolved from their iguanodon-like ornithopod ancestors in asia about 110 million years ago, during the middle cretaceous period. if this scenario is correct, then eolambia was one of the earliest hadrosaurs to colonize north america (via the alaskan land bridge from eurasia); its missing-link status can be inferred from "iguanodont" characteristics like its spiked thumbs. eolambia was named in reference to another, later north american hadrosaur, lambeosaurus, which was itself named after the famous paleontologist lawrence m. lambe.
