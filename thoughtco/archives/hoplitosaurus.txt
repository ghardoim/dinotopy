discovered in south dakota in 1898, and named four years later, hoplitosaurus is one of those dinosaurs that lingers on the fringes of the official record books. at first, hoplitosaurus was classified as a species of stegosaurus, but then paleontologists realized they were dealing with a different beast altogether: an early ankylosaur, or armored dinosaur. the trouble is, a convincing case has yet to be made that hoplitosaurus wasn't really a species (or specimen) of polacanthus, a contemporaneous ankylosaur from western europe. today, it just barely retains genus status, a situation that may change pending future fossil discoveries.
