considering how famous and talented they were, othniel c. marsh and edward drinker cope left a lot of damage in his wake, which has taken over a century to clean up. othnielosaurus was erected in the 20th century to house the homeless remnants of a series of plant-eating dinosaurs named by marsh and cope during the late 19th-century bone wars, often on the basis of insufficient evidence, including othnielia, laosaurus, and nanosaurus. as definitive as a genus can get, given the vast reams of confusion that preceded it, othnielosaurus was a small, bipedal, herbivorous dinosaur closely related to hypsilophodon, and was certainly hunted and eaten by the larger theropods of its north american ecosystem.
