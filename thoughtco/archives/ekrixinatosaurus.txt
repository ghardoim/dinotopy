the most interesting thing about some dinosaurs is their names. that's certainly the case with ekrixinatosaurus, a nearly unpronounceable jumble of greek roots that translates roughly as "explosion-born lizard." it's a reference to the fact that this large theropod's bones were discovered during construction-related blasting in argentina, and which has nothing to do with the extinction of the dinosaurs 65 million years ago. ekrixinatosaurus (about 20 feet long and weighing 1 ton) is classified as an abelisaur (and hence a relative of abelisaurus), and it also shared some characteristics (such as its unusually tiny and stunted arms) with the better-known majungatholus and carnotaurus.
