pretty much every continent on earth witnessed its share of titanosaurs--the large, lightly armored descendants of the sauropods--during the cretaceous period. along with aragosaurus, tastavinsaurus was one of the few titanosaurs known to have lived in spain; this 50-foot-long, 10-ton plant-eater had some anatomical characteristics in common with pleurocoelus, the obscure state dinosaur of texas, but otherwise, it remains poorly understood thanks to limited fossil remains. (as to why these dinosaurs evolved their armor in the first place, that was doubtless a reaction to the evolutionary pressure of pack-hunting tyrannosaurs and raptors.)
