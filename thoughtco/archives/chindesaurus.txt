to demonstrate just how plain-vanilla the first dinosaurs of the late triassic period were, chindesaurus was initially classified as an early prosauropod, rather than an early theropod--two very different types of dinosaur that still looked remarkably similar at that relatively early time in evolution. later, paleontologists determined conclusively that chindesaurus was a close relative of the south american theropod herrerasaurus, and probably a descendant of this more famous dinosaur (since there's strong evidence that the first true dinosaurs originated in south america).
