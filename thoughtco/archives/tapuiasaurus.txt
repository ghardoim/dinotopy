it was during the early cretaceous period that sauropods started evolving the thick, knobby armor that characterized the first titanosaurs. dating to about 120 million years ago, the south american tapuiasaurus was probably only recently sprung from its sauropod ancestors, hence this titanosaur's modest size (only about 40 feet from head to tail) and presumably rudimentary armor. tapuiasaurus is one of the few titanosaurs to be represented in the fossil record by a near-complete skull (discovered recently in brazil), and it was a distant forebear of the better-known asian titanosaur nemegtosaurus.
