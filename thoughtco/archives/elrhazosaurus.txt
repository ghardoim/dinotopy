dinosaur fossils not only have a lot to tell us about local ecosystems but also about the distribution of the world's continents tens of millions of years ago, during the mesozoic era. until recently, the early cretaceous elrhazosaurus—the bones of which were discovered in central africa—was considered to be a species of a similar dinosaur, valdosaurus, hinting at a land connection between these two continents. the assignment of elrhazosaurus to its own genus has muddied the waters somewhat, though there's no disputing the kinship between these two bipedal, plant-eating, toddler-sized ornithopods.
