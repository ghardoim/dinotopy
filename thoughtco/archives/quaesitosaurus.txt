like another titanosaur of central asia, nemegtosaurus, most of what we know about quaesitosaurus has been reconstructed from a single, incomplete skull (the rest of this dinosaur's body has been deduced from the more complete fossils of other sauropods). in many ways, quaesitosaurus appears to have been a typical titanosaur, with its elongated neck and tail and bulky body (which may or may not have sported rudimentary armor). based on analysis of the skull--which has unusually large ear openings--quaesitosaurus may have had a sharp hearing, though it's unclear if this differentiated it from other titanosaurs of the late cretaceous period.
