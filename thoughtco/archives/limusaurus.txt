every now and then, paleontologists unearth a dinosaur that throws a big, looping curveball into accepted dogma. that's what has happened with limusaurus (about 5 feet long, 75 pounds), a very early ceratosaur (a type of large theropod, or bipedal, meat-eating dinosaur) with a beaked snout and no teeth. what this almost certainly means (though not all paleontologists have accepted this conclusion) is that limusaurus was more likely a vegetarian, whereas virtually all other theropod genera (with the exception of some therizinosaurs and ornithomimids) are known to have subsisted on meat. as such, this relatively early (late jurassic) ceratosaur may have represented a transitional form between earlier vegetarians and later carnivores.
