there's an interesting story behind the name aletopelta, greek for "wandering shield": although this dinosaur lived in late cretaceous mexico, its remains were discovered in modern-day california, the result of continental drift over tens of millions of years. we know that aletopelta was a true ankylosaur thanks to its thick armor plating (including two dangerous-looking spikes jutting up from its shoulders) and clubbed tail, but otherwise, this low-slung herbivore resembled a nodosaur, a sleeker, more lightly built, and (if possible) even slower subfamily of the ankylosaurs.
