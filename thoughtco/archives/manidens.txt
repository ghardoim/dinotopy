the heterodontosaurids—the family of ornithopod dinosaurs epitomized by, you guessed it, heterodontosaurus—were some of the strangest and most poorly understood dinosaurs of the early to middle jurassic period. the recently discovered manidens ("hand tooth") lived a few million years after heterodontosaurus, but (judging by its strange dentition) it seems to have pursued roughly the same lifestyle, possibly including an omnivorous diet. as a rule, heterodontosaurids were fairly small (the largest example of the genus, lycorhinus, didn't exceed 50 pounds soaking wet), and it's likely that they had to adapt their diets to their close-to-the-ground position in the dinosaur food chain.
