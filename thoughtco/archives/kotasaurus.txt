either a very advanced prosauropod (the early line of herbivorous dinosaurs that gave rise to the giant sauropods of the later jurassic period) or a very early sauropod, kotasaurus has been reconstructed from the remains of 12 separate individuals, the bones of which were found tangled together in a riverbed in india. (the most likely scenario is that a herd of kotasaurus were drowned in a flash flood, then piled up on the bank downriver.) today, the only place to see a kotasaurus skeleton is at the birla science museum in hyderabad, india.
