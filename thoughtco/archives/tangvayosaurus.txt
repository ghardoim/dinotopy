one of the few dinosaurs ever to be discovered in laos, tangvayosaurus was a medium-sized, lightly armored titanosaur--the family of lightly armored sauropods that achieved a worldwide distribution by the end of the mesozoic era. like its close and slightly earlier relative phuwiangosaurus (which was discovered in nearby thailand), tangvayosaurus lived at a time when the very first titanosaurs were beginning to evolve from their sauropod ancestors and had yet to attain the gigantic sizes of later genera like the south american argentinosaurus.
