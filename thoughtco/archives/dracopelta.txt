one of the earliest known ankylosaurs, or armored dinosaurs, dracopelta roamed the woodlands of western europe during the late jurassic period, tens of millions of years before its more famous descendants like ankylosaurus and euoplocephalus of late cretaceous north america and eurasia. as you might expect in such a "basal" ankylosaur, dracopelta wasn't much to look at, only about three feet long from head to tail and covered in rudimentary armor along its head, neck, back, and tail. also, like all ankylosaurs, dracopelta was relatively slow and clumsy; it probably flopped on its stomach and curled into a tight, armored ball when threatened by predators, and its brain-to-body-mass ratio indicates that it wasn't especially bright.
