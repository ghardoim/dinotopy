to those unfamiliar with the greek language, the name erectopus may seem slightly naughtyâ€”but it actually means nothing more titillating than "upright foot." the remains of this meat-eating dinosaur were discovered in france in the late 19th century, and since then it has had a complicated taxonomic history. like many carnivores of dubious provenance, this dinosaur which was about 10 feet long and weighed 500 pounds, was initially classified as a species of megalosaurus (m. superbus), then renamed erectopus sauvagei by the german paleontologist friedrich von huene. after that, it spent almost the next 100 years in dinosaur limbo, until it was reassessed in 2005 as a close (but much smaller) relative of allosaurus.
