when its type fossil was first discovered, in utah in 1923, arrhinoceratops seemed to be missing the small nose horn possessed by most ceratopsians; hence its name, greek for "no-nose horned face." wouldn't you know it, arrhinoceratops had a horn after all, making it a very close cousin of triceratops and torosaurus (which may have been the same dinosaur). this small mixup aside, arrhinoceratops was very much like other ceratopsians of the late cretaceous period, a four-footed, elephant-sized herbivore that likely used its long horns to battle other males for the right to mate.
