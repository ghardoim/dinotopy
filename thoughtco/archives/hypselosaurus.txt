as an example of how scattered and fragmentary the remains of some titanosaurs are, paleontologists have identified 10 separate specimens of hypselosaurus, yet they've still only been able to roughly reconstruct what this dinosaur looked like. it's unclear if hypselosaurus had armor (a feature shared by most other titanosaurs), but its legs were clearly thicker than those of most of its breed, and it had relatively small and weak teeth. its odd anatomical quirks aside, hypselosaurus is most famous for its fossilized eggs, which measure a full foot in diameter. fittingly for this dinosaur, though, even the provenance of these eggs is subject to dispute; some experts think they actually belong to the huge, prehistoric, flightless bird gargantuavis.
