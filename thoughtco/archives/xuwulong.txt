there hasn't been a lot published about xuwulong, an early cretaceous ornithopod from china that lay near the split between the "iguanodontid" ornithopods (that is, those with a marked resemblance to iguanodon) and the very first hadrosaurs, or duck-billed dinosaurs. like other iguandontids, the ungainly-looking xuwolong possessed a thick tail, a narrow beak, and long hind legs on which it could run away when threatened by predators. perhaps the most unusual thing about this dinosaur is the "long," meaning "dragon," at the end of its name; usually, this chinese root is reserved for more fearsome meat-eaters like guanlong or dilong.
