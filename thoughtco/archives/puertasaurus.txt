although argentinosaurus is the best-attested giant titanosaur of late cretaceous south america, it was far from the only one of its kind--and it may well have been eclipsed in size by puertasaurus, the huge vertebrae of which hint at a dinosaur that measured over 100 feet long from head to tail and weighed as much as 100 tons. (another south american titanosaur in this size class was futalognkosaurus, and an indian genus, bruhathkayosaurus, may have been even bigger.) since titanosaurs are known from frustratingly scattered and incomplete fossil remains, though, the true title-holder for "world's biggest dinosaur" remains undecided.
