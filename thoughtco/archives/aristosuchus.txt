despite the familiar "suchus" (greek for "crocodile") in the latter part of its name, aristosuchus was a full-fledged dinosaur, although one that remains poorly understood. this smallish, western european theropod seems to have been closely related to both the north american compsognathus and the south american mirischia; it was initially classified as a species of poekilopleuron by the famous paleontologist richard owen, way back in 1876, until harry seeley assigned it to its own genus a few years later. as for the "noble" part of its name, there's no indication that aristosuchus was more refined than the other meat-eaters of the early cretaceous period!
