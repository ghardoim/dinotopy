lapparentosaurus--a mid-sized sauropod of middle jurassic madagascar--is all that remains of the genus once known as bothriospondylus, which was named by the famous paleontologist richard owen in the late 19th century (and has been the subject of ample confusion ever since). because it's represented by only limited fossil remains, lapparentosaurus remains a somewhat mysterious dinosaur; all we can say with any certainty is that it was closely related to brachiosaurus. (this dinosaur, by the way, honors the same french scientist as the ornithopod delapparentia.)
