as the earliest steel-plated wagon was to a sherman tank, so gargoyleosaurus was to the later (and more famous) ankylosaurusâ€”a distant ancestor that began experimenting with body armor during the late jurassic period, tens of millions of years before its more formidable descendant. as far as paleontologists can tell, gargoyleosaurus was the first true ankylosaur, a type of herbivorous dinosaur typified by its squat, ground-hugging build and plated armor. the whole point of ankylosaurs, of course, was to present as unappetizing a prospect as possible to ravenous predators--who had to flip these plant-eaters on their backs if they wanted to inflict a mortal wound.
