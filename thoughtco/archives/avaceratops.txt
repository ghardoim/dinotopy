named after the wife of the man who discovered its remains, avaceratops may have been an unusually big-headed ceratopsian. the sole specimen is f a juvenile, and the babies and juveniles of most vertebrates tend to have proportionately bigger heads compared to the rest of their bodies. because there's a lot paleontologists don't know about the growth stages of ceratopsians, it may yet turn out that avaceratops was a species of an existing genus; as things stand, it seems to have occupied an intermediate evolutionary stage between the better-known centrosaurus and triceratops.
