perhaps because the rain jungle isn't a very congenial place for paleontological expeditions, very few dinosaurs have been discovered in brazil's amazon basin. to date, one of the only known genera is amazonsaurus, a moderately sized, early cretaceous sauropod that seems to have been related to the north american diplodocus, and that is represented by very limited fossil remains. amazonsaurus--and other "diplodocoid" sauropods like it--is noteworthy in that it was one of the last "basal" sauropods, which were eventually supplanted by the titanosaurs of the middle to late cretaceous period.
