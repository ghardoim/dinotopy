closely related to another, more famous, central asian theropod, oviraptor, citipati partook of the same devoted child-rearing behavior: the fossilized specimens of this emu-sized dinosaur were found sitting atop clutches of its own eggs, in poses identical to those of modern nesting birds. clearly, by the latter part of the cretaceous period, the feathered citipati (along with other dino-birds) was already well along toward the avian end of the evolutionary spectrum, though it's unclear whether modern birds counted oviraptors among their direct ancestors.
