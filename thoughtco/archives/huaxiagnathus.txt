huaxiagnathus towered over the numerous other "dino-birds" (not to mention the actual birds) that have recently been discovered in the famous liaoning fossil beds of china; at six feet in length and some 75 pounds, this theropod was significantly larger than more famous feathered kin like sinosauropteryx and compsognathus, and had correspondingly longer, more capably grasping hands. as with many liaoning discoveries, a near-complete specimen of huaxiagnathus, lacking only the tail, has been found preserved across five large slabs of stone.
