acanthopholis was a typical example of a nodosaur, a family of ankylosaur dinosaurs characterized by their low-slung profiles and tough coats of armor (in the case of acanthopholis, this formidable plating was assembled out of oval structures called "scutes.") where its turtle-like shell stopped, acanthopholis sprouted dangerous-looking spikes from its neck, shoulder and tail, which presumably helped protect it from the bigger cretaceous carnivores that tried to turn it into a quick snack. like other nodosaurs, however, acanthopholis lacked the lethal tail club that characterized its ankylosaur relatives.
