ceratopsians are often described with reference to late cretaceous giants like triceratops and styracosaurus, but the fact is that these herbivores existed (in less impressive form) as far back as the late jurassic period. chaoyangsaurus is one of the earliest ceratopsians yet known, predating the previous record-holder, psittacosaurus, by tens of millions of years (and just about tied with its fellow asian horned face, yinlong). this three-foot-long herbivore looks more like an ornithopod and is only identified as a ceratopsian thanks to the unique structure of its beak.
