during the 19th century, a huge number of ornithopods were classified as species of iguanodon, and then promptly consigned to the fringes of paleontology. in 2012, gregory s. paul rescued one of these forgotten species, iguanodon hollingtoniensis, and elevated it to genus status under the name huxleysaurus (honoring thomas henry huxley, one of the first devoted defenders of charles darwin's theory of evolution). a couple of years earlier, in 2010, another scientist had "synonymized" i. hollingtoniensis with hypselospinus, so as you can imagine, the ultimate fate of huxleysaurus is still up in the air.
