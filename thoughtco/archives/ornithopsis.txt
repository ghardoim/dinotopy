it's amazing how many waves a single fossilized vertebra can make. when it was first discovered in the isle of wight, in the mid-19th century, ornithopsis was identified by the british paleontologist harry seeley as an obscure "missing link" between birds, dinosaurs, and pterosaurs (hence its name, "bird face," even though the type fossil lacked a skull). a few years later, richard owen threw his own brand of murk on the situation by assigning ornithopsis to iguanodon, bothriospondylus and an obscure sauropod named chondrosteosaurus. today, all we know about the original type fossil of ornithoposis is that it belonged to a titanosaur, which may (or may not) have been closely related to fellow english genera like cetiosaurus.
