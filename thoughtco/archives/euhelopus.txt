not much progress has been made regarding euhelopus, description- and classification-wise, since this late jurassic sauropod was unearthed in china way back in the 1920's, the first of its kind ever to be discovered so far east (though it's since been succeeded by numerous chinese sauropod discoveries). from its single, fragmentary fossil, we do know that euhelopus was a very long-necked sauropod, and its general appearance (especially its long front legs and short hind legs) was reminiscent of the much better-known brachiosaurus of north america.
