when its intact fossil (complete with the impressions of feathers) was discovered a few years ago in china, jinfengopteryx was initially identified as a prehistoric bird, and then as an early avian pioneer comparable to archaeopteryx; only later did paleontologists notice some marked similarities with the troodont theropods (a family of feathered dinosaurs epitomized by troodon). today, jinfengopteryx's blunt snout and enlarged hind claws point to it having been a genuine dinosaur, albeit one well along the "bird" end of the evolutionary spectrum.
