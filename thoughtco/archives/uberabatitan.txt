unusually for a titanosaur--the large, lightly armored descendants of the giant sauropods of the jurassic period--uberabatitan is represented by three separate fossil specimens of different sizes, all found in the brazilian geological formation known as the bauru group. what makes this cacophonously named dinosaur special is that it's the youngest titanosaur yet to be discovered in this region, "only" about 70 to 65 million years old (and thus may have still been roaming around when the dinosaurs went extinct at the end of the cretaceous period).
