today, the one name most people associate with transylvania is dracula--which is somewhat unfair, since some important dinosaurs (like telmatosaurus) have been discovered in this region of romania. elopteryx certainly has a gothic provenance--its "type fossil" was discovered at some indeterminate point around the turn of the 20th century by a romanian paleontologist, and later wound up in the british museum of natural history--but beyond that, very little is known about this dinosaur, which is considered a nomen dubium by most authorities. the best we can say is that elopteryx was a feathered theropod, and it was most closely related to troodon (though even that much is disputed!)
