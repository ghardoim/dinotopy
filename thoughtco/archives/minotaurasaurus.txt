a faint whiff of disrepute hangs around minotaurosaurus, which was announced as a new genus of ankylosaur (armored dinosaur) in 2009. this late cretaceous plant eater is represented by a single, spectacular skull, which many paleontologists believe actually belonged to a specimen of another asian ankylosaur, saichania. since we don't know much about how the skulls of ankylosaurs changed as they aged, and hence which fossil specimens belong to which genera, this is a far from uncommon situation in the dinosaur world.
