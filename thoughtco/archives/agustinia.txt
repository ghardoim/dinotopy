although this titanosaur, or armored sauropod, was named after agustin martinelli (the student who discovered the "type fossil"), the driving force behind the identification of agustinia was the famous south american paleontologist jose f. bonaparte. this large herbivorous dinosaur is known only by very fragmentary remains, which are sufficient nonetheless to establish that agustinia had a series of spines along it's back, which likely evolved for display purposes rather than a means of defense against predators. in this respect, agustinia resembled another famous south american titanosaur, the earlier amargasaurus.
