xuanhuaceratops was one of the earliest ceratopsians, the line of herbivorous dinosaurs that evolved from ornithopods during the late jurassic period and culminated in giant north american genera like triceratops and pentaceratops during the late cretaceous, tens of millions of years later. xuanhuaceratops was closely related to another early ceratopsian, chaoyangsaurus, which may have predated it by a few million years (and thus may have been its direct ancestor).
