not the most well-known sauropod in the dinosaur bestiary, rebbachisaurus is important for when and where it lived--northern africa during the middle cretaceous period. based on the similarity of rebbachisaurus to later south american titanosaurs, africa and south america may still have been joined by a land bridge as recently as 100 million years ago (these continents had previously been merged together in the supercontinent gondwana). other than this odd geological detail, rebbachisaurus is notable for the tall spines that jutted out from its vertebrae, which may have supported a sail or hump of skin (or simply may have been there for decorative purposes).
