described by the famous argentinean paleontologist jose bonaparte in 1999--who named his find after the popular dinosaur-book author and science popularizer don lessem--lessemsaurus was one of the largest prosauropods of late triassic south america, measuring a full 30 feet from head to tail and weighing in the neighborhood of two tons (which still wasn't much compared to the giant sauropods of the late jurassic period). this plant-eater shared its habitat with, and may have been closely related to, another plus-sized south american prosauropod, the better-known riojasaurus. like other prosauropods, lessemsaurus was distantly ancestral to the giant-sized saurpods and titanosaurs of the later mesozoic era.
