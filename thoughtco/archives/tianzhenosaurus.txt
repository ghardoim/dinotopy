for whatever reason, the armored dinosaurs discovered in china tend to be better-preserved than their counterparts in north america. witness tianzhenosaurus, which is represented by a nearly complete skeleton discovered in the huiquanpu formation in shanxi province, including a spectacularly detailed skull. some paleontologists suspect that tianzhenosaurus is really a specimen of another well-preserved chinese ankylosaur of the late cretaceous period, saichania ("beautiful"), and at least one study has placed it as a sister genus to the contemporary pinacosaurus.
