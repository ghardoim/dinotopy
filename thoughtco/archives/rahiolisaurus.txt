thanks to the vagaries of the fossilization process, very few dinosaurs have been discovered in india, the chief culprits being moderately sized "abelisaur" theropods like indosuchus and strange-looking sauropods like isisaurus. unusually, the rahiolisaurus (about 25 feet long, 1 ton) is represented by seven incomplete, tangled specimens, which may have drowned in a flash flood or even dragged to this location by scavengers after they died during the late cretaceous. the main thing that distinguished this meat eater from its close contemporary rajasaurus is that it was relatively slender or gracile, rather than thickly built or robust. other than that, we know very little about its appearance or how it lived.
