one of the few dinosaurs to be discovered in the former soviet satellite state of kazakhstan, aralosaurus was a large hadrosaur, or duck-billed dinosaur, of the middle to late cretaceous period, which is pretty much all we can say for certain, since all that's been found of this gentle herbivore is a single chunk of skull. we do know that aralosaurus possessed a noticeable "hump" on its snout, with which it probably created loud honking noises--either to signal desire or availability to the opposite sex or to warn the rest of the herd about approaching tyrannosaurs or raptors.
