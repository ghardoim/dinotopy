in most ways, coahuilaceratops was a typical ceratopsian ("horned face") dinosaur of the late cretaceous period: a slow-witted, big-headed herbivore that was the approximate size and weight of a small truck. what set this genus apart from more famous relatives like triceratops were the paired, forward-curving horns set above its eyes, which reached a whopping four feet in length; in fact, coahuilaceratops is the longest-horned dinosaur yet discovered. the length and shape of these appendages suggest that males of the genus may have literally "locked horns" when competing for females, much as big-horned sheep do today.
