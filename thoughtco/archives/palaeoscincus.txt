the early american paleontologist joseph leidy loved to name new dinosaurs based only on their teeth, often with unfortunate results years down the road. a good example of his over-eagerness is palaeoscincus, the "ancient skink," a dubious genus of ankylosaur, or armored dinosaur, that didn't survive much beyond the early 19th century. oddly enough, before it was superseded by better-attested genera like euoplocephalus and edmontonia, palaeoscincus was one of the best-known armored dinosaurs, accumulating no less than seven separate species and commemorated in various books and toys for children.
