anatomically, this dinosaur shared some characteristics with the much smaller, "basal" ceratopsians that preceded it by millions of years (the most notable example being psittacosaurus), but it was much bigger than these early plant-eaters, full-grown adults possibly weighing as much as a ton. even more tantalizingly, the fact that basal ceratopsians were mostly bipedal hints that udanoceratops may also have spent most of its time on two legs, which would make it by far the largest such ceratopsian.
