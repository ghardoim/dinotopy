the otherwise obscure ferganasaurus is notable for two reasons: first, this sauropod dates from a relatively unknown stretch of the jurassic period, about 165 million years ago (most sauropods discovered so far lived at least 10 or 15 million years later). and second, this was the first dinosaur ever to be discovered in the ussr, albeit in a region, kyrgyzstan, that has since separated from russia. given the state of soviet paleontology back in 1966, it may not be surprising that the "type fossil" of ferganasaurus was neglected for decades, until a second expedition in 2000 found additional specimens.
