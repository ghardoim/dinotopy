considering that entire dinosaurs have been reconstructed from scarcer fossil evidence, it seems odd that genyodectes has proven so hard to classify. this meat-eater is represented by a single, superbly preserved set of choppers, which look like the giant-sized false teeth from a children's cartoon. since its type fossil was described in 1901, genyodectes has been classified as a tyrannosaur, an abelisaur, and a megalosaur. lately, the trend has been to lump it in with the ceratosaurs, which would make it a close relative of ceratosaurus. oddly enough, considering its tangled history, genyodectes was the most well-attested large south american theropod until a series of spectacular fossil finds starting in the 1970s.
