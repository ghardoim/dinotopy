as a result of their bizarre head ornamentation, the skulls of ceratopsians tend to preserve better in the fossil record than the rest of their skeletons. a case in point is albertaceratops, which is represented by a single complete skull discovered in alberta, canada in 2001. for all intents and purposes, albertaceratops wasn't much different from other horned, frilled dinosaurs of the late cretaceous period, with the exception of its unusually long brow horns combined with a centrosaurus-like skull. based on this feature, one paleontologist has concluded that albertaceratops is the most "basal" (earliest, simplest) ceratopsian in the centrosaurus lineage.
