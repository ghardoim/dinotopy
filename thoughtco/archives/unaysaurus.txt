as far as paleontologists can tell, the first meat-eating dinosaurs evolved in south america about 230 million years ago--and these small theropods then branched off into the very first prosauropods, or "sauropodomorphs," the ancient cousins of the giant sauropods and titanosaurs of the jurassic and cretaceous periods. unaysaurus may well have been one of the first true prosauropods, a slender, 200-pound plant-eater that probably spent much of its time walking on two legs. this dinosaur was closely related to plateosaurus, a slightly later (and much more famous) prosauropod of late triassic western europe.
