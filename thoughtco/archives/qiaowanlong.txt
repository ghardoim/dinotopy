until recently, brachiosaurus-like sauropods were thought to be confined to north america, but that all changed in 2007 with the discovery of qiaonwanlong, an asian sauropod that (with its long neck and longer front than back legs) resembled a two-thirds-scale copy of its more famous cousin. to date, qiaowanlong has been "diagnosed" based on a single incomplete skeleton; further discoveries should help ascertain its exact place on the sauropod family tree. (on the other hand, since most north american dinosaurs of the mesozoic era had their counterparts in eurasia, it's not too surprising that brachiosaurus should have an asian relative!)
