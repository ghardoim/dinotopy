one of the more mysterious hadrosaurs, or duck-billed dinosaurs, of the middle to the late cretaceous period, jaxartosaurus has been reconstructed from scattered skull fragments found near the syr darya river, known as the jaxartes in ancient times. like many hadrosaurs, jaxartosaurus had a prominent crest on its head (which was probably larger in males than in females, and may have been used to produce piercing calls), and this dinosaur probably spent most of its time grazing on low-lying bushes in a quadrupedal posture â€” though it may have been capable of running away on two feet to escape pursuing tyrannosaurs and raptors.
