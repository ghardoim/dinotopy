in most ways, dryosaurus (its name, "oak lizard," refers to the oak-leaf-like shape of some of its teeth) was a plain-vanilla ornithopod, typical in its small size, bipedal posture, stiff tail, and five-fingered hands. like most ornithopods, dryosaurus probably lived in herds, and this dinosaur may have raised its young at least halfway (that is, at least for a year or two after they hatched). dryosaurus also had especially large eyes, which raises the possibility that it was a smidgen more intelligent than other herbivores of the late jurassic period.
