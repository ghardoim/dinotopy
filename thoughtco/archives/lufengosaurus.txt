an otherwise unremarkable prosauropod (the line of quadrupedal, herbivorous dinosaurs that preceded the giant sauropods) of the late jurassic period, lufengosaurus had the honor of being the first dinosaur ever mounted and displayed in china, an event that was commemorated in 1958 with an official postage stamp. like other prosauropods, lufengosaurus probably nibbled on the low-lying branches of trees, and may have been capable of (occasionally) rearing up on its hind legs. about 30 more-or-less complete lufengosaurus skeletons have been assembled, making this herbivore a common exhibit in china's natural history museums.
