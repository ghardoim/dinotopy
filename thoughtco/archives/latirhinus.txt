a partial anagram for altirhinus — a slightly earlier duckbilled dinosaur with an equally prominent nose — latirhinus languished in a museum vault for a quarter of a century, where it was classified as a specimen of gryposaurus. we may never know why latirhinus (and other hadrosaurs like it) had such a big nose; this may have been a sexually selected characteristic (that is, males with bigger noses had the opportunity to mate with more females) or this dinosaur may have used its snout to communicate with loud grunts and snorts. oddly enough, it's unlikely that latirhinus had a particularly sharp sense of smell, at least compared to other plant-eating dinosaurs of the late cretaceous period!
