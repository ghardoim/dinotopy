as you may have guessed from its name, indian crocodile, indosuchus wasn't identified as a dinosaur when its scattered remains were first discovered in 1933, in southern india (which, even today, is not exactly a hotbed of dinosaur research). it was only much later that this 20-foot-long creature was reconstructed as a large theropod, closely related to the south american abelisaurus, and thus a devoted hunter of the small- to mid-sized hadrosaurs and titanosaurs of late cretaceous central asia. the indosuchus kinship with a south american dinosaur can no doubt be explained by the distribution of the earth's continents during the mesozoic era.
