nemegtosaurus is a bit of an anomaly: whereas most skeletons of titanosaurs (the sauropods of the late cretaceous period) are missing their skulls, this genus has been reconstructed from a single partial skull and part of the neck. the head of nemegtosaurus has been likened to that of diplodocus: it's small and relatively narrow, with small teeth and an unimpressive lower jaw. aside from its noggin, though, nemegtosaurus appears to have been similar to other asian titanosaurs, such as aegyptosaurus and rapetosaurus. it's an entirely different dinosaur from the similarly named nemegtomaia, a feathered dino-bird.
