fossil hunter nicholas longrich certainly had his mojo on when he diagnosed this new ceratopsian dinosaur based on a skull he found in storage at the american museum of natural history in new york (along with other partial skulls residing in canadian museums).
mojoceratops' claim to fame is that its frill was even more elaborate than that of its closest relative, centrosaurus: a tall, wide, bone-supported sail of skin that probably changed color with the seasons. to judge by its underlying skeletal structure, mojoceratops' frill was probably heart-shaped, which was fitting in that males used their frills to broadcast sexual availability (or desire) to the females of the herd.
