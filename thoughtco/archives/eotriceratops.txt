even as some paleontologists argue that the roster of ceratopsians (horned, frilled dinosaurs) needs to be severely trimmed—on the theory that some of these dinosaurs were actually growth stages of existing dinosaurs—others have persisted in naming new genera. a good example is eotriceratops, which the average person would find virtually indistinguishable from triceratops but which merits its own name thanks to some obscure anatomical features (for example, the shape of its jugal horn, epoccipitals, and premaxilla). interestingly, the "type specimen" of eotriceratops bears bite marks above the left eye, perhaps remnants of an encounter with a hungry tyrannosaurus rex.
