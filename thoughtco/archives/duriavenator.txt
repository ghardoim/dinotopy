paleontologists don't always spend their time out in the field digging up new dinosaurs. sometimes they have to rectify the errors made by previous generations of scientists. duriavenator is the genus name assigned in 2008 to what had previously been classified as a species of megalosaurus, m. hesperis. (in the mid-19th century, a bewildering variety of theropods were classified as megalosaurus by paleontologists who hadn't yet grasped the full scope of theropod evolution.) the middle jurassic duriavenator is one of the earliest identified tetanuran ("stiff-tailed") dinosaurs, preceded (perhaps) only by cryolophosaurus.
