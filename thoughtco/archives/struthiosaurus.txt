it's a common theme in evolution that animals restricted to small islands tend to grow to small sizes, so as not to overconsume local resources. this seems to have been the case with struthiosaurus, a six-foot-long, 500-pound nodosaur (a subfamily of ankylosaurs) that looked positively puny compared to giant contemporaries like ankylosaurus and euoplocephalus. judging by its scattered fossil remains, struthiosaurus lived on small islands bordering the present-day mediterranean sea, which must also have been populated by miniature tyrannosaurs or raptorsâ€”or else why would this nodosaur have needed such thick armor?
