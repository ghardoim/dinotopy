considering how many raptors and dino-birds prowled central asia during the late cretaceous period, you can understand why ankylosaurs like gobisaurus evolved their thick body armor during the course of the cretaceous period. discovered in 1960, during a joint russian and chinese paleontological expedition to the gobi desert, gobisaurus was an unusually large armored dinosaur (to judge by its 18-inch-long skull), and it seems to have been closely related to shamosaurus. one of its contemporaries was the three-ton theropod chilantaisaurus, with which it probably had a predator/prey relationship.
