to date, not much information has been released about aucasaurus, a near-complete skeleton of which was discovered in argentina in 1999. we do know that this carnivorous theropod was closely related to two other famous dinosaurs of south america, abelisaurus and carnotaurus, but it was significantly smaller (about 13 feet long and 500 pounds), with longer arms and bumps on its head instead of horns. based on the dire condition of its skull, it's possible that the only identified specimen of aucasaurus was done in by a fellow predator, either in a head-on attack or after it had died of natural causes.
