it has proven difficult to classify the early, or "basal," ornithopods of middle jurassic china, most of which looked alike. hexinlusaurus (named after a chinese professor) was until recently classified as a species of the equally obscure yandusaurus, and both of these plant-eaters had traits in common with agilisaurus (in fact, some paleontologists believe that the diagnostic specimen of hexinlusaurus was really a juvenile of this better-known genus). wherever you choose to place it on the dinosaur family tree, hexinlusaurus was a small, skittery reptile that ran on two legs to avoid being eaten by larger theropods.
