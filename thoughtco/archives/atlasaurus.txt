atlasaurus is only indirectly named after atlas, the titan of greek myth who propped up the heavens on his back: this middle jurassic sauropod was discovered in morocco's atlas mountains, which were themselves named after the same legendary figure. the unusually long legs of atlasaurus--longer than any other known genus of sauropod--point to its unmistakable kinship with the north american and eurasian brachiosaurus, of which it seems to have been a southern offshoot. unusually for a sauropod, atlasaurus is represented by a single, near-complete fossil specimen, including a good portion of the skull.
