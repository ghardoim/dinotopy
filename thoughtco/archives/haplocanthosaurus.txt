despite its complicated-sounding name (greek for "single-spined lizard"), haplocanthosaurus was a relatively uncomplicated sauropod of the late jurassic period, closely related to (but significantly smaller than) its more famous cousin brachiosaurus. the only adult skeleton of a haplocanthosaurus is on permanent display at the cleveland museum of natural history, where it goes by the simpler (and much more pronounceable) name "happy." (by the way, haplocanthosaurus was originally named haplocanthus, the person responsible for the change being under the impression that the latter name had already been assigned to a genus of prehistoric fish.)
