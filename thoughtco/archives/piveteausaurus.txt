as with many dinosaurs, the main reason piveteausaurus (about 25 feet long, 1 ton) isn't better known is that it has been mired in controversy ever since its discovery, and naming, nearly a century ago. the fossils of this sizable theropod have been variously assigned to streptospondylus, eustreptospondylus, proceratosaurus, and even allosaurus. the only body part that seems to belong to piveteausaurus is a fragment of the braincase, and even that is the subject of some dispute. what we do know about this dinosaur is that it was a fearsome predator of middle to late jurassic europe and possibly the apex reptile of its local french ecosystem.
