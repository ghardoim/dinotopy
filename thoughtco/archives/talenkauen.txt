ornithopods—small, herbivorous, bipedal dinosaurs—were sparse on the ground in late cretaceous south america, with only a handful of genera discovered so far. talenkauen stands apart from other south american ornithopods like anabisetia and gasparinisaura in that it bore a distinct resemblance to the much better known iguanodon, with a long, thick body and an almost comically small head. the fossils of this dinosaur include an intriguing set of oval-shaped plates lining the rib cage; it's unclear if all ornithopods shared this feature (which has been rarely preserved in the fossil record) or if it was limited to just a few species.
