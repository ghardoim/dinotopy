one of the few early theropods to be discovered in sub-saharan africa, nqwebasaurus is known from a single, incomplete skeleton, probably a juvenile. based on an analysis of this fossil's unusual hands--the long first fingers were partially opposable to the second and third--experts have concluded that this small dinosaur was an omnivore that literally clutched at anything it could eat, a conclusion backed up by the preservation of gastroliths in its gut (these "stomach stones" are useful accessories for grinding up vegetable matter).
