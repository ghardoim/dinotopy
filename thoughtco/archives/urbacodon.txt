urbacodon is a truly international dinosaur: the "urbac" in its name is an acronym for "uzbek, russian, british, american and canadian," the nationalities of the paleontologists who participated in the dig in uzbekistan where it was discovered. known from only a piece of its jawbone, urbacodon seems to have been closely related to two other feathered theropods of eurasia, byronosaurus, and mei (and all three of these dinosaurs are technically classified as "troodonts," in reference to the much more famous troodon).
