barring a better hypothesis, paleontologists believe that the first dinosaurs, the early theropods, evolved in south america about 230 million years ago, spawned by a population of advanced, two-legged archosaurs. discovered recently in argentina, sanjuansaurus seems to have been closely related to the better-known basal theropods herrerasaurus and eoraptor. (by the way, some experts maintain that these early carnivores weren't true theropods at all, but rather predated the split between saurischian and ornithischian dinosaurs). that's all we know for sure about this triassic reptile, pending further fossil discoveries.
