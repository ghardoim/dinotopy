ironically enough, the near-complete skeleton of agilisaurus was discovered during the construction of a dinosaur museum adjacent to china's famous dashanpu fossil beds. judging by its slender build, long hind legs and stiff tail, agilisaurus was one of the earliest ornithopod dinosaurs, though its exact place on the ornithopod family tree remains a matter of dispute: it may have been more closely related to either heteredontosaurus or fabrosaurus, or it may even have occupied an intermediate position between true ornithopods and the earliest marginocephalians (a family of herbivorous dinosaurs that comprises both pachycephalosaurs and ceratopsians).
