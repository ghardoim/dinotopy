gryphoceratops, which measured a bare two feet from head to tail, didn't boast any of the elaborate ornamentations of its larger, more famous cousins. what gryphoceratops did have in common with triceratops and its ilk was its tough, horny beak, which it used to clip off equally tough vegetation. the smallest ceratopsian yet discovered in north america (it was dug up very close to canada's dinosaur provincial park), gryphoceratops was closely related to the equally "basal" leptoceratops.
