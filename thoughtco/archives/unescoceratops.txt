the newly discovered unescoceratops wasn't the smallest ceratopsian (horned, frilled dinosaur) that ever lived—that honor belongs to "basal" species like leptoceratops—but it still didn't have much to brag about. about five feet long from head to tail, unescoceratops only weighed about as much as a healthy, adult human, and it possessed a short frill and a tough, horny beak reminiscent of a parrot's. the most notable thing about this dinosaur is its name: it was discovered near canada's dinosaur provincial park, a world heritage site administered by unesco (the united nations educational, scientific and cultural organization).
