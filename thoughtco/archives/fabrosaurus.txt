fabrosaurus—named after the french geologist jean fabre—occupies a murky place in the annals of dinosaur history. this tiny, two-legged, plant-eating ornithopod was "diagnosed" based on a single incomplete skull, and many paleontologists believe that it was actually a species (or specimen) of another herbivorous dinosaur from early jurassic africa, lesothosaurus. fabrosaurus (if it really existed as such) may also have been ancestral to a slightly later ornithopod of eastern asia, xiaosaurus. any more conclusive determination of its status will have to await future fossil discoveries.
