its name--greek for "angola giant"--pretty much sums up everything that's currently known about angolatitan, the first dinosaur ever to be discovered in this war-torn african nation. identified by the fossilized remains of its right forelimb, angolatitan was clearly a type of titanosaur--the lightly armored, late cretaceous descendants of the giant sauropods of the jurassic period--and it seems to have lived in a parched desert habitat. because the "type specimen" of angolatitan was found in deposits that have also yielded the fossils of prehistoric sharks, it has been speculated that this individual met its doom when it blundered into shark-infested waters, though we'll probably never know for sure.
