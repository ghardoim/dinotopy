china's liaoning fossil beds are famous for their profusion of small, feathered dinosaurs, but occasionally they deliver the equivalent of a paleontological curveball. a good example is liaoningosaurus, an early cretaceous armored dinosaur that seems to have existed very near the ancient split between ankylosaurs and nodosaurs. even more remarkably, the "type fossil" of liaoningosaurus is a two-foot-long juvenile with armor plating along its belly as well as its back. belly armor is virtually unknown in adult nodosaurs and ankylosaurs, but it's possible that juveniles had and gradually shed this feature, since they were more vulnerable to being flipped over by hungry predators.
