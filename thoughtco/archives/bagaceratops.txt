most of the ceratopsians ("horned faces") of the late cretaceous period were gigantic, multi-ton earth-shakers like triceratops, but millions of years earlier, in the eastern regions of asia, these dinosaurs were much more petite. one such smaller dinosaur was bagaceratops, which only measured about three feet long from snout to tail and weighed just 50 pounds. this fairly obscure, minimally ornamented ceratopsian ancestor is known mostly by the partial remains of various skulls; a complete skeleton has yet to be unearthed, but it's clear that bagaceratops closely resembled the other primitive ceratopsians of the middle-to-late cretaceous.
