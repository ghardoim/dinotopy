fifty million years before its sauropod descendants roamed the earth, euskelosaurus--which is classified as a prosauropod, or "before the sauropods"--must have been a common sight in the woodlands of africa, judging by the number of fossils that have been recovered there. this was the first dinosaur ever to be discovered in africa, in the mid-1800's, and at 30 feet long and two tons it was certainly one of the largest land creatures of the triassic period. euskelosaurus was a close relative of two other large prosauropods, riojasaurus in south america and its fellow african plant-eater melanorosaurus.
