not a week goes by, it seems, without somebody, somewhere, discovering yet another iguanodont ornithopod of the middle cretaceous period. the fragmented fossils of proa were unearthed in spain's teruel province a few years ago; the oddly shaped "predentary" bone in this dinosaur's lower jaw inspired its name, which is greek for "prow." all we know for sure about proa is that it was a classic ornithopod, similar in appearance to iguanodon and literally dozens of other genera, whose main function was to serve as a reliable food source for hungry raptors and tyrannosaurs.
