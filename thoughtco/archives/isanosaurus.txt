not to be confused with pisanosaurus--a roughly contemporary ornithopod from south america--isanosaurus may well have been one of the first true sauropods, appearing in the fossil record about 210 million years ago (near the triassic/jurassic boundary). frustratingly, this plant-eater is known by only a few scattered bones discovered in thailand, which nonetheless point to a dinosaur intermediate between the most advanced prosauropods and the earliest sauropods. further confusing matters, the "type specimen" of isanosaurus is of a juvenile, so it's difficult to tell how big this sauropod was fully grown--and whether it rivaled the size of another ancestral sauropod of late triassic south africa, antetonitrus.
