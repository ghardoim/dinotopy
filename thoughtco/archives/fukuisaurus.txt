not to be confused with fukuiraptor—a moderately sized theropod discovered in the same region of japan—fukuisaurus was a moderately sized ornithopod that probably resembled (and was closely related to) the much better-known iguanodon from eurasia and north america. since they lived at roughly the same time, the early to middle cretaceous period, it's possible that fukuisaurus figured on fukuiraptor's lunch menu, but as yet there's no direct evidence for this--and because ornithopods are so rare on the ground in japan, it's difficult to establish fukuisaurus' exact evolutionary provenance.
