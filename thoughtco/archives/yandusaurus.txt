once a fairly secure dinosaur genus comprising two named species, yandusaurus has since been whittled down by paleontologists to the point that this small ornithopod is no longer even included in some dinosaur bestiaries. the most prominent yandusaurus species was reassigned a few years ago to the better-known agilisaurus and was subsequently re-re-reassigned to a completely new genus, hexinlusaurus. classified as "hypsilophodonts," all of these small, herbivorous, bipedal dinosaurs were closely related to, you guessed it, hypsilophodon, and had a worldwide distribution during most of the mesozoic era.
