in the late 19th century, the american fossil hunters edward drinker cope and othniel c. marsh were mortal enemies, constantly trying to one-up (and even sabotage) one another on their numerous paleontological digs. that's why it's ironic that the small, two-legged ornithopod drinker (named after cope) may be exactly the same animal as the small, two-legged ornithopod othnielia (named after marsh); the differences between these dinosaurs are so minimal that they may one day be collapsed into the same genus.
