as you can guess from its name--mongolian for "foot"--kol is represented in the fossil record by a single, well-preserved foot. still, this sole anatomical remnant is enough for paleontologists to classify kol as an alvarezsaur, a family of small theropods exemplified by the south american alvarezsaurus. kol shared its central asian habitat with the larger, more bird-like shuvuuia, with which it probably shared a coat of feathers, and it may have been preyed on by the ubiquitous velociraptor. by the way, kol is one of a trio of three-letter dinosaurs, the others being the asian mei and the western european zby.
