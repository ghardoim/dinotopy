kaijiangosaurus (13 feet long and 500 pounds) from the late jurassic period is one of those dinosaurs that has been consigned to the "almost, but not quite" netherworld of paleontology. this large theropod (technically, a carnosaur) was discovered in china in 1984, in the same formation that yielded the better known, and much more amusingly named, gasosaurus. in fact, most paleontologists believe that kaijiangosaurus was either a specimen or a species of this more famous dinosaur, which wasn't technically gassy but discovered during a dig on gas-bearing sediments. only further fossil discoveries can decide the issue one way or the other.
