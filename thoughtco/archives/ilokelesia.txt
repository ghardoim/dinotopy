ilokelesia (about 14 feet long) was one of a wide variety of abelisaurs—small- to medium-sized theropod dinosaurs closely related to abelisaurus—that inhabited south america during the middle to late cretaceous period. this 500-pound meat-eater stood out from the pack thanks to its broader-than-usual tail and the structure of its skull. its closest relative was the much bigger and much more dangerous mapusaurus. there's still a lot that paleontologists don't know about the evolutionary relationship of abelisaurs to other theropod families, which is why dinosaurs like ilokelesia are a subject of intensive study.
