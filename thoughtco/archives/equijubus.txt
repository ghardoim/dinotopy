along with plant-eaters like probactrosaurus and jinzhousaurus, equijubus (greek for "horse mane") occupied an intermediate stage between the iguanodon-like ornithopods of the early cretaceous period and the full-blown hadrosaurs, or duck-billed dinosaurs, that arrived millions of years later and occupied the expanse of north america and eurasia. equijubus was fairly large for a "basal" hadrosaur (some adults may have weighed as much as three tons), but this dinosaur may still have been capable of running away on two legs when chased by ravenous theropods.
