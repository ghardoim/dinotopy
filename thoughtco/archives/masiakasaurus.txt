if ever a dinosaur needed braces, it was the masiakasaurus. the teeth of this smallish theropod (6 feet long, 100-200 pounds) were angled outward toward the front of its mouth, an adaptation that presumably evolved for a good reason. the most likely explanation is that masiakasaurus subsisted on fish, which it speared with its front choppers. then again, maybe this particular individual simply needed to take a trip to a cretaceous orthodontist. masiakasaurus is notable for another reason: the only known species, masiakasaurus knopfleri, is named after former dire straits frontman mark knopfler, for the simple reason that knopfler's music happened to be playing when this fossil was unearthed on the indian ocean island of madagascar.
