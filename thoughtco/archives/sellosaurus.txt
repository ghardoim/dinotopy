it sounds like the caption to a new yorker cartoon--"now get out there and be a sellosaurus!"--but this early herbivorous dinosaur of the triassic period was in fact a fairly typical prosauropod, the remote precursors of huge plant-eaters like diplodocus and argentinosaurus. sellosaurus is fairly well represented in the fossil record, with over 20 partial skeletons cataloged so far. it was once thought that sellosaurus was the same animal as efraasia--another triassic prosauropod--but now most paleontologists believe that this dinosaur is best classified as a species of another famous prosauropod, plateosaurus.
