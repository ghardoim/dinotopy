one of the latest additions to the hadrosaur family, there's not much to say about velafrons except that it was very similar to two better-known north american genera, corythosaurus and hypacrosaurus. like its fellow, dim-witted herbivores, velafrons was distinguished by an ornate crest on its head, which was likely used to produce sounds (and may, secondarily, have been a sexually selected characteristic). also, despite its impressive size (about 30 feet long and three tons), velafrons was capable of running away on its two hind legs when it was startled by raptors or tyrannosaurs.
