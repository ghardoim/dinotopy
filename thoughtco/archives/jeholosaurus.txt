there's something about prehistoric reptiles named after the jehol region of northern china that occasions controversy. jeholopterus, a genus of pterosaur, has been reconstructed by one scientist as having fangs, and possibly sucking the blood of bigger dinosaurs (granted, very few people in the scientific community subscribe to this hypothesis). jeholosaurus, a small, ornithopod dinosaur, also possessed some odd dentitionâ€”sharp, carnivore-like teeth in the front of its mouth and blunt, herbivore-like grinders in the back. in fact, some paleontologists speculate that this presumed close relative of hypsilophodon may have pursued an omnivorous diet, a startling adaptation (if true) since the vast majority of ornithischian dinosaurs were strict vegetarians.
