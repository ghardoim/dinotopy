as is the case with many titanosaurs--the lightly armored descendants of the giant sauropods of the late jurassic period--all we know about argyrosaurus is based on a fossil fragment, in this case, a single forelimb. prowling the woodlands of south america a few million years before truly gigantic titanosaurs like argentinosaurus and futalognkosaurus, argyrosaurus (the "silver lizard") wasn't quite in these dinosaurs' weight class, though it was still a sizable herbivore, measuring 50 to 60 feet from head to tail and weighing in the neighborhood of 10 to 15 tons.
