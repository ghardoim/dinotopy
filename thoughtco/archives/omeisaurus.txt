pound for pound, omeisaurus was probably the most common sauropod of late jurassic china, at least to judge by its numerous fossil remains. various species of this unusually long-necked plant-eater have been unearthed over the last few decades, the smallest measuring only about 30 feet long from head to tail and the largest having a neck of about the same size. this dinosaur's closest relative appears to have been the even longer-necked sauropod mamenchisaurus, which had a whopping 19 neck vertebrae compared to the 17 of omeisaurus.
