named after the magyars--one of the ancient tribes that settled modern-day hungary--magyarosaurus is a striking example of what biologists call "insular dwarfism": the tendency of animals confined to isolated ecosystems to grow to smaller sizes than their relatives elsewhere. whereas most titanosaurs of the late cretaceous period were truly enormous beasts (measuring anywhere from 50 to 100 feet long and weighing 15 to 100 tons), magyarosaurus was a mere 20 feet long from head to tail and weighed one or two tons, tops. it's possible that this elephant-sized titanosaur spent most of its time in low-lying swamps, dipping its head beneath the water to find tasty vegetation.
