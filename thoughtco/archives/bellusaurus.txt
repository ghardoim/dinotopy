if tv networks had existed back in the late jurassic period, bellusaurus would have been the lead item on the six o'clock news: this sauropod is represented by no less than 17 juveniles found in a single quarry, their bones tangled together after all of them had drowned in a flash flood. needless to say, bellusaurus grew to larger sizes than the 1,000-pound specimens unearthed in china; some paleontologists maintain that this was the same dinosaur as the obscure klamelisaurus, which measured about 50 feet from head to tail and weighed anywhere from 15 to 20 tons.
