ornithopods, like titanosaurs, had a worldwide distribution during the middle to late cretaceous period. the importance of siamodon is that it's one of the few dinosaurs to be discovered in modern-day thailand (a country that used to be known as siam)--and, like its close cousin probactrosaurus, it lay close to the evolutionary juncture when the first true hadrosaurs branched off from their ornithopod forebears. to date, siamodon is known from only a single tooth and a fossilized braincase; further discoveries should shed additional light on its appearance and lifestyle.
