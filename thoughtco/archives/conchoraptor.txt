the oviraptors--small, feathered theropods typified by, and closely related to, the well-known oviraptor--of late cretaceous central asia seem to have pursued a wide variety of prey. judging by its squat, muscular jaws, paleontologists speculate that the five-foot-long, twenty-pound conchoraptor made its living by cracking the shells of ancient mollusks (including conchs) and feasting on the soft internal organs within. lacking further direct evidence, though, it's also possible that conchoraptor fed on hard-shelled nuts, vegetation, or even (for all we know) other oviraptors.
