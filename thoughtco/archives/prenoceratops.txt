you'd have to be a trained paleontologist to distinguish prenoceratops from its more famous relative, leptoceratops, which lived a few million years later. both of these ceratopsians (horned, frilled dinosaurs) were small, slender, unobtrusive plant-eaters with minimal frills, a far cry from "classic" members of the breed like triceratops and pentaceratops. one among dozens of ceratopsian genera of the late cretaceous period, prenoceratops stands out from the pack in at least one way: its fossils were discovered in montana's famous two medicine formation.
