as you can guess from its name--greek for "wonderful pelvis"--mirischia possessed an unusual pelvic structure, with an asymmetrical ischium (in fact, this dinosaur's full name is mirischia asymmetrica). one of the innumerable small theropods populating middle cretaceous south america, mirischia seems to have been most closely related to the earlier, north american compsognathus, and also had some traits in common with the western european aristosuchus. there are some tantalizing hints that mirischia's oddly shaped pelvis harbored an air sac, yet more support for the evolutionary line connecting the small theropods of the late mesozoic era and modern birds.
