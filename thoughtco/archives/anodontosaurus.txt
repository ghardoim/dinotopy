anodontosaurus, the "toothless lizard," has a tangled taxonomic history. this dinosaur was named in 1928 by charles m. sternberg, on the basis of a fossil specimen missing its teeth (sternberg theorized that this ankylosaur chewed its food with something he called "trituration plates"), and almost half a century later it was "synonymized" with a species of euoplocephalus, e. tutus. more recently, though, a re-analysis of the type fossils prompted paleontologists to revert anodontosaurus back to genus status. like the better-known euoplocephalus, the two-ton anodontosaurus was characterized by its almost comical level of body armor, along with a lethal, hatchet-like club on the end of its tail.
