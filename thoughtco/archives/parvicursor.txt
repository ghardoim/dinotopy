if parvicursor were better represented in the fossil record, it might take the prize as the smallest dinosaur that ever lived. as things stand, though, it's hard to make judgments based on the this central asian alvarezsaur's partial remains: it may have been a juvenile rather than an adult, and it may also have been a species (or specimen) of better-known feathered dinosaurs like shuvuuia and mononykus. what we do know is that the type fossil of parvicusor measures barely a foot from head to tail, and that this theropod couldn't have weighed more than a third of a pound soaking wet!
