not the most euphoniously named of all dinosaurs, metriacanthosaurus ("moderate-spined lizard") was mistakenly classified as a species of megalosaurus when its incomplete fossil remains were discovered in england in 1923—not an uncommon occurrence, since many large theropods of the late jurassic period started out under the megalosaurus umbrella. we still don't know a whole lot about this 25-foot-long dinosaur, except it probably weighed about a ton and that the short spines jutting out from its vertebrae may have supported a slender hump or sail—a hint that metriacanthosaurus was perhaps ancestral to more famous sailed carnivores like the much later spinosaurus.
