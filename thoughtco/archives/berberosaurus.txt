the early jurassic period wasn't exactly a hotbed of dinosaur fossils, which is why the moderately sized, bipedal berberosaurus is so important and so frustrating at the same time. ever since this theropod was discovered in moroccoâ€™s atlas mountains, it has bounced around the classification bins. first, berberosaurus was pegged as an abelisaur; then as a dilophosaur (that is, a close relative of the better-known dilophosaurus); and finally, though tentatively, as a ceratosaur. whatever its ultimate disposition, berberosaurus was doubtless a fearsome predator, feasting on the smaller theropods and prosauropods of its african habitat.
