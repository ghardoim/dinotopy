saturnalia (named, because of the time of year it was discovered, after the famous roman festival) is one of the earliest plant-eating dinosaurs yet discovered, but aside from that its exact place on the dinosaur evolutionary tree is a matter of dispute. some experts classify saturnalia as a prosauropod (the line of small, slender plant eaters distantly related to the giant sauropods of the jurassic and cretaceous periods), while other maintain that its anatomy is too "undifferentiated" to merit this conclusion and simply lump it in with the earliest dinosaurs. whatever the case, saturnalia was much smaller than most of the herbivorous dinosaurs that succeeded it, only about the size of a small deer.
