otherwise a plain-vanilla hadrosaur of the late cretaceous period, gilmoreosaurus is important for what it has revealed about dinosaur pathology: the susceptibility of these ancient reptiles to various diseases, including cancer. strangely, numerous vertebrae of gilmoreosaurus individuals show evidence of cancerous tumors, putting this dinosaur in a select group that also includes the hadrosaurs brachylophosaurus and bactrosaurus (of which gilmoreosaurus may actually have been a species). scientists still don't know what caused these tumors; it's possible that inbred populations of gilmoreosaurus had a genetic propensity for cancer, or perhaps these dinosaurs were exposed to unusual pathogens in their central asian environment.
