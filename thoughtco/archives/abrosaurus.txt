abrosaurus is one of those paleontological exceptions that prove the rule: most of the sauropods and titanosaurs of the mesozoic era fossilized without their skulls, which were easily detached from their bodies after death, but its preserved skull is all we know about this dinosaur. abrosaurus was fairly small for a sauropod--"only" about 30 feet from head to tail and about five tons--but that can be explained by its middle jurassic provenance, 10 or 15 million years before the truly gigantic sauropods of the late jurassic period like diplodocus and brachiosaurus. this herbivore seems to have been most closely related to the slightly later (and much better-known) north american sauropod camarasaurus.
