sometime in the middle triassic period, probably in south america, the very first "sauropodomorphs" (also known as prosauropods) diverged from the earliest theropods. panphagia is as good a candidate as any for this important transitional form: this dinosaur shared some important characteristics with early theropods like herrerasaurus and eoraptor (notably in its small size and bipedal posture), but also had some traits in common with early prosauropds like saturnalia, not to mention the giant sauropods of the late jurassic period. panphagia's name, greek for "eats everything," refers to its presumed omnivorous diet, which would make sense for a dinosaur perched between the carnivorous theropods that preceded it and the herbivorous prosauropods and sauropods that came after.
