in the course of the early cretaceous period, the largest and most advanced ornithopods (typified by iguanodon) began to evolve into the very first hadrosaurs, or duck-billed dinosaurs. dating to about 100 million years ago, nanyangosaurus has been classified as an iguanodontid ornithopod laying near (or at) the base of the hadrosaur family tree. specifically, this plant-eater was significantly smaller than later duckbills (only about 12 feet long and half a ton), and may already have lost the prominent thumb spikes that characterized other iguanodont dinosaurs.
