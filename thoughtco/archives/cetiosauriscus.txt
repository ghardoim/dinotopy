as you might guess, there's a story behind cetiosauriscus ("like cetiosaurus") and cetiosaurus itself. that story, however, is too long and boring to go into here; suffice it to say that both of these sauropods were known by one name or the other, dating back to the late 19th century, and the confusion was only cleared up in 1927. nomenclature issues aside, cetiosauriscus was a fairly unremarkable plant-eating dinosaur of the late jurassic period, almost as closely related to the north american diplodocus as it was to its european namesake.
