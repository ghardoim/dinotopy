the "type fossil" of the titanosaur antarctosaurus was discovered on the southernmost tip of south america; despite its name, it's unclear if this dinosaur actually lived in nearby antarctica (which, during the cretaceous period, had a much warmer climate). it's also unclear if the handful of species discovered so far belong to this genus: one specimen of antarctosaurus measures about 60 feet from head to tail, but the other, at over 100 feet, rivals argentinosaurus in size. in fact, antarctosaurus is such a jigsaw puzzle that scattered remains found in india and africa may (or may not) wind up being assigned to this genus!
