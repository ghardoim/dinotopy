amurosaurus may be the best-attested dinosaur ever to be discovered within the confines of russia, although its fossils were unearthed on the far fringes of this vast country, near its eastern border with china. there, an amurosaurus bonebed (which was probably deposited by a sizable herd that met its end in a flash flood) has allowed paleontologists to painstakingly piece together this large, late cretaceous hadrosaur from various individuals. as far as experts can tell, amurosaurus was very similar to the north american lambeosaurus, hence its classification as a "lambeosaurine" hadrosaur.
