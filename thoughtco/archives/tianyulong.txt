tianyulong has thrown the dinosaur equivalent of a monkey wrench into the carefully wrought classification schemes of paleontologists. previously, the only dinosaurs known to have sported feathers were small theropods (two-legged carnivores), mostly raptors and associated dino-birds (but possibly juvenile tyrannosaurs as well). tianyulong was a different creature entirely: an ornithopod (small, herbivorous dinosaur) whose fossil bears the unmistakable imprint of long, hairy proto-feathers, thus possibly hinting at a warm-blooded metabolism. long story short: if tianyulong sported feathers, so could any dinosaur, no matter what its diet or lifestyle.
