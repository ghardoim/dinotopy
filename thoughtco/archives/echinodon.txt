ornithopods—the family of mostly small, mostly bipedal, and completely unfeathered herbivorous dinosaurs—are the last creatures you would expect to sport mammal-like canines in their jaws, the strange feature that makes echinodon such an unusual fossil find. like other ornithopods, echinodon was a confirmed plant-eater, so this dental equipment is a bit of a mystery—but perhaps a bit less so once you realize this tiny dinosaur was related to the equally strangely toothed heterodontosaurus (the "different toothed lizard"), and possibly to fabrosaurus as well.
