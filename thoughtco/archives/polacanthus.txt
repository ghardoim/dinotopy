one of the most primitive nodosaurs (a family of armored dinosaurs included under the ankylosaur umbrella), polacanthus is also one of the earliest known: the "type fossil" of this spiked plant-eater, minus the head, was discovered in england in the mid-19th century. considering its relatively modest size, compared to other ankylosaurs, polacanthus sported some impressive armament, including bony plates lining its back and a series of sharp spikes running from the back of its neck all the way to its tail (which lacked a club, as did the tails of all nodosaurs). however, polacanthus wasn't quite as impressively arrayed as the most impenetrable ankylosaurs of them all, the north american ankylosaurus and euoplocephalus.
