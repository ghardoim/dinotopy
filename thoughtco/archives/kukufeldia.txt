you could write an entire book about all the dinosaurs that were once mistaken for iguanodon (or, rather, assigned to this genus by the puzzled paleontologists of the 19th century, such as gideon mantell). for well over a hundred years, kukufeldia was classified as a species of iguanodon, on the evidence of single fossilized jaw housed at the london natural history museum. that all changed in 2010 when a student inspecting the jaw noticed some subtle anatomical peculiarities and convinced the scientific community to erect the new ornithopod genus kukufeldia ("cuckoo's field," after the old english name for the locality where the jaw was discovered).
