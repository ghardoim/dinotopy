dating to the early cretaceous period, about 125 million years ago, auroraceratops resembled a larger version of small, "basal" ceratopsians like psittacosaurus and archaeoceratops, with a minimal frill and the barest beginnings of a nasal horn. in its considerable size, however—about 20 feet from head to tail and one ton—auroraceratops anticipated the larger, "classic" ceratopsians of the late cretaceous period like triceratops and styracosaurus. it's conceivable that this plant-eater occasionally walked on two legs, but definitive evidence for this is lacking.
