it's hard to work up much of a sweat about a dinosaur named "piatnitzky," but the fierce carnivore piatnitzkysaurus (14 feet long, 1,000 pounds) terrorized the plant-eaters of middle jurassic south america. closely related to another early theropod, megalosaurus, piatnitzkysaurus was distinguished by the crests on its head and its long, stiff tail, which it probably used for balance when chasing down prey. it clearly partook of the same body plan as later, bigger, and more dangerous theropods like allosaurus and tyrannosaurus rex.
