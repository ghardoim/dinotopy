one of the innumerable titanosaurs--the lightly armored descendants of the sauropods--to be discovered in south america, neuquensaurus was a medium-sized member of the breed, "only" weighing 10 to 15 tons or so. like most titanosaurs, neuquensaurus had light armor coating its neck, back, and tail--to the extent that it was initially misidentified as a genus of ankylosaur--and it was also once classified as a species of the mysterious titanosaurus. it may yet turn out that neuquensaurus was the same dinosaur as the slightly earlier saltasaurus, in which case the latter name would take precedence.
