for the last 75 years or so, australia has been a relative wasteland when it comes to sauropod discoveries. that all changed in 2009, with the announcement of not one, but two new sauropod genera: diamantinasaurus and wintonititan, comparably sized titanosaurs represented by sparse fossil remains. like most titanosaurs, wintonititan probably had a rudimentary layer of armored skin along its back, the better to deter the large, hungry theropods of its australian ecosystem. (as to how titanosaurs wound up in australia in the first place, tens of millions of years ago, this continent was part of the giant landmass pangaea.)
