despite its name--greek for "cowardly lizard"--there's no reason to believe that ignavusaurus was any less brave than any other early prosauropod, the ancient cousins and distant progenitors of the sauropods (though at only five feet long and 50 to 75 pounds, this gentle herbivore would have made a quick snack for the larger and hungrier theropods of its day). the "coward" part of its moniker actually derives from the region of africa where this dinosaur's remains were found, the name of which translates roughly as "home of the coward's father."
