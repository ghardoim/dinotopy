the nine-syllable name micropachycephalosaurus may sound like a mouthful, but it's not so bad if you break it down into its constituent greek roots: micro, pachy, cephalo, and saurus. that translates into "tiny thick-headed lizard," and fittingly, micropachycephalosaurus seems to have been the smallest of all the known pachycephalosaurs (otherwise known as bone-headed dinosaurs). for the record, one of the dinosaurs with the shortest given names (mei) was also bite-sized; make of that what you will!
but hold the jurassic phone: despite its imposing name, micropachycephalosaurus may turn out not to have been a pachycephalosaur at all, but a very small (and very basal) ceratopsian, or horned, frilled dinosaur. in 2011, paleontologists closely examined the bone-headed dinosaur family tree and were unable to find a convincing place for this multisyllabic dinosaur; they also re-examined the original fossil specimen of micropachycephalosaurus and were unable to confirm the existence of a thickened skull (that part of the skeleton was missing from the museum collection).
what if, despite this recent classification, micropachycephalosaurus is re-re-assigned as a true bonehead? well, because this dinosaur has been reconstructed from a single, incomplete fossil discovered in china (by the famous paleontologist dong zhiming), the possibility looms that it may one day be "downgraded"--that is, paleontologists will agree that it's another type of pachycephalosaur entirely. (the skulls of pachycephalosaurs changed as these dinosaurs aged, meaning that a juvenile of a given genus is often incorrectly assigned to a new genus). if micropachycephalosaurus winds up losing its place in the dinosaur record books, some other multisyllabic dinosaur (possibly opisthocoelicaudia) will rise up to assume the "world's longest name" title.
