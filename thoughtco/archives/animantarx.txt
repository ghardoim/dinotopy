true to its name—greek for "living fortress"—animantarx was an unusually spiky nodosaur (a subfamily of the ankylosaurs, or armored dinosaurs, which lacked clubbed tails) that lived in middle cretaceous north america and seems to have been closely related to both edmontonia and pawpawsaurus. what's most interesting about this dinosaur, though, is the way it was discovered: it has long been known that fossil bones are slightly radioactive, and an enterprising scientist used radiation-detecting equipment to dredge up the bones of animantarx, sight unseen, from a utah fossil bed.
