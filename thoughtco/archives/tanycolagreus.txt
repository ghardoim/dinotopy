for a decade after its partial remains were discovered in 1995, in wyoming, tanycolagreus was thought to be a specimen of another slender meat-eating dinosaur, coelurus. further study of its distinctive-looking skull then prompted it to be assigned to its own genus, but tanycolagreus still remains grouped among the many slender, early theropods that preyed on the small carnivorous and herbivorous dinosaurs of the late jurassic period. these dinosaurs, as a whole, were not that far evolved from their primitive forebears, the very first theropods that sprang up in south america during the middle triassic period, 230 million years ago.
