discovered in 2008 by the globe-trotting paleontologist paul sereno, kryptops is a rare example of a north african theropod (technically an abelisaur) from the middle cretaceous period. this dinosaur wasn't especially big, "only" about 25 feet long and less than a ton, but it was distinguished by the weird, horny skin that seemed to have covered its face (this coating was probably made of keratin, the same stuff as human fingernails). despite its fearsome appearance, kryptops' relatively short, blunt teeth point to its having been a scavenger rather than an active hunter.
