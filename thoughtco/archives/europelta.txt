closely related to ankylosaurs (and often classified under that umbrella), nodosaurs were squat, four-legged dinosaurs covered with knobby, nearly impenetrable armor, but lacked the tail clubs that their ankylosaur cousins wielded with such catastrophic effect. the importance of the recently discovered europelta, from spain, is that it's the earliest identified nodosaur in the fossil record, dating to the middle cretaceous period (about 110 to 100 million years ago). the discovery of europelta also confirms that european nodosaurs differed anatomically from their north american counterparts, probably because many of them were stranded for millions of years on isolated islands dotting the western european continent.
