panamericansaurus is one of those dinosaurs whose name length is inversely proportional to its body length: this late cretaceous titanosaur "only" measured about 30 feet from head to tail and weighed in the vicinity of five tons, making it a true shrimp compared to truly massive titanosaurs like argentinosaurus. a close relative of aeolosaurus, panamericansaurus was named not after the now-defunct airline but the pan american energy co. of south america, which sponsored the argentine dig where this dinosaur's remains were discovered.
