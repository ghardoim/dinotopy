as a general rule, any dinosaur that was ever classified as a species of iguanodon has had a complicated taxonomic history. one of the few dinosaurs to be discovered in modern-day austria, mochlodon was designated as iguanodon suessii in 1871, but it soon became clear that this was a much more petite ornithopod that deserved its own genus, created by harry seeley in 1881. a few years later, one mochlodon species was referred to the better-known rhabdodon, and in 2003, another was split off into the new genus zalmoxes. today, so little is left of the original mochlodon that it's widely considered a nomen dubium, though some paleontologists continue to use the name.
