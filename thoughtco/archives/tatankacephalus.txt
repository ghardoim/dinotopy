no, tatankacephalus had nothing to do with armored tanks; this name is actually greek for "buffalo head" (and it had nothing to do with buffalos, either!) based on an analysis of its skull, tatankacephalus appears to have been a relatively small, low-slung ankylosaur of the middle cretaceous period, less imposing (and if possible, even less bright) than its descendants (such as ankylosaurus and euoplocephalus) that lived tens of millions of years later. this armored dinosaur was unearthed from the same fossil deposits that yielded another early north american ankylosaur, sauropelta.
