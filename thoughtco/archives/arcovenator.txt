the importance of arcovenator (about 20 feet long and 1,000-2,000 pounds) is that it's one of the few abelisaurs to have radiated as far afield as western europe (another example being tarascosaurus). note: the abelisaurs were a breed of medium-to-large size meat-eating dinosaurs that originated in south america toward the middle of the mesozoic era and then spread to other parts of the world (while still remaining clustered, for the most part, on their home continent). in any event, this fearsome, 20-foot-long arcovenator seems to have been most closely related to majungasaurus from the island of madagascar and also to rajasaurus, which was discovered in india. as you can imagine, what this implies for the evolution of abelisaurs during the late cretaceous period is still being worked out.
