its name--greek for "condor thief"--may be the best-understood thing about condorraptor, which was initially diagnosed based on a single tibia (leg bone) until a near-complete skeleton was unearthed a couple of years later. this "small" (only about 400 pound) theropod dates to the middle jurassic period, about 175 million years ago, a relatively obscure stretch of the dinosaur timeline--so further examination of condorraptor's remains should shed some much-needed light on the evolution of large theropods. (by the way, despite its name, condorraptor wasn't a true raptor like the much later deinonychus or velociraptor.)
