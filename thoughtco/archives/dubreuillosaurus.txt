not the most easily spelled (or pronounced) dinosaur, dubreuillosaurus was only diagnosed in 2005 on the basis of a partial skeleton (it was originally thought to have been a species of the even more obscure meat-eater poekilopleuron). now classified as a megalosaur, a type of large theropod closely related to megalosaurus, dubreuillosaurus (25 feet long and 2 tons) was characterized by its unusually long skull, which was three times as long as it was thick. it's unknown exactly why this theropod evolved this feature, but it probably had something to do with its accustomed diet during the jurassic period.
