next to ceratopsians--the horned, frilled dinosaurs native to north america and eurasia--titanosaurs count among some the most common fossil discoveries. yongjinglong is typical of its breed in that it was "diagnosed" on the basis of a partial skeleton (amounting to a single shoulder blade, some of the ribs and a handful of vertebrae), and its head is entirely missing except for a few teeth. like other titanosaurs, yongjinglong was an early cretaceous offshoot of the giant sauropods of the late jurassic period, lumbering its 10-ton bulk across the swampy expanses of asia in search of tasty vegetation.
