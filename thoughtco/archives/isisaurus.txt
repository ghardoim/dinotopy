when its bones were dug up in 1997, isisaurus was identified as a species of titanosaurus; only after further analysis was this titanosaur assigned its own genus, named after the indian statistical institute (which houses many dinosaur fossils). reconstructions are necessarily fanciful, but by some accounts isisaurus may have looked like a giant hyena, with long, powerful front limbs and a relatively short neck held parallel to the ground. also, analysis of this dinosaur's coprolites has revealed fungal remains from several varieties of plants, giving us a good insight into isisaurus' diet.
