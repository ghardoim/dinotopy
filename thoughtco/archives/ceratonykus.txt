ceratonykus is one of the latest examples of an alvarezsaur, a mysterious branch of relatively small, bird-like, theropod dinosaurs (closely related to raptors) that sported feathers, bipedal stances, and long legs with correspondingly small arms. since it was diagnosed based on a single incomplete skeleton, relatively little is known about the central asian ceratonykus or its evolutionary relationship to other dinosaurs and/or birds, other than that it was a prototypical, probably feathered "dino-bird" of the late cretaceous period.
