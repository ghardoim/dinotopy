as portrayed in the jurassic park movies,velociraptorâ was recreated at twice its actual size and closely modelled onâ deinonychus. though this was seen as unscientific at the time, soon after the first film was released, a dinosaur of the same type,â utahraptor, was discovered, even larger than the virtualâ velociraptors.â
velociraptor is now thought to have had a fine feather-like covering.
