aardonyx is known from 2 immature individuals. adults would have been much larger, probably over 10m.
aardonyx would have been largely bipedal (walking on 2 legs) but also capable of walking on all 4 legs. this and its way of feeding are transitional features between those of basal sauropodomorphs and the more derived sauropods (large dinosaurs that walked on all fours) that came later.
